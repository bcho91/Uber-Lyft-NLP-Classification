And for the first time ever were flying and not taking a car. We will be relying 100% on lyft/uber while we stay there.

But I'm wondering how busy can it get for you drivers in this area? Cause I have some activities in mind for example going to the miami seaquarium. And I'm wondering if it will be easy to grab a ride or can it get really backed up and take forever to find a driver?

1615401358,Lyft,"tw c/ptsd  


Okay so, I'm a former pack a day cigarette smoker, weaned down to about 4 ecig pods a week, with a few cold quit attempts during the past year of this quitting journey. I'm also formerly homeless, and have cptsd. Before this ride, I was on yet another nicotine quit attempt and it was going pretty well for a couple weeks, but I started to feel a paranoid and the insomnia I was having was messing with my head a lot. So I broke down and went to get some pods.  


The only place that sells pods is a gas station just down the street from where I live. It's far enough away to be about an hour walk for me, but short enough to be the kind of ride a Lyft driver probably wouldn't like unless they knew they were getting a good tip. I always tip at least $5, sometimes $7 or $8, sometimes $15 if I'm flush. Depends how much I have to spare. I was pretty generous with my first stimulus check last year, but these days, like everybody else, I'm broke, so I'm zeroing my bank account to do right by whoever shuffles me to the gas station and back.  


I don't have phone service right now, only wifi, so I can't book two separate trips. So, it's one round trip to pick up some nicotine pods from the gas station. Usually the wait is under 2 minutes, since I usually go around 8:00-10:00 am and there's hardly anybody there.   


Drivers have always been chill about it, but the last one was different. I got in the car, told him it was just a quick trip. I can't tell if he gets it but he had turned his head so he heard me. We get there, and the parking lot is deserted. Absolutely no one inside but the cashier.   


The driver didn't slide in a parking space, but pulled up sideways like he was just going to drop me off, so I let him know again that it was round trip. He nodded so I got out, a bit nervously. As soon as I shut the door, he started rolling towards the street.   


I thought maybe I can catch him, so I went straight to the counter as always, got my pods, came out just in time to see him turning onto the road. He was still technically there in the time it took me to get in and out.   


(insert Danny Devito meme)

Well anyways, I started dissociating.  


This would be fine if I had data, but I didn't. There was no public wifi or anything around. After a couple minutes I snapped my brain on, it'd be fine. I'll just walk. I've walked a million miles, what's a couple more? On the walk back, I checked my phone every couple minutes for public wifi. Nothing but a list of password protected wifi. I gave up once I reached my neighborhood, which is a pretty dense neighborhood. I had a few streets to cross, then one turn home.  


Remember I said I was formerly homeless and had cptsd? Being abandoned was the first check off the list. Walking an hour or so, by myself, through town, with everyone having access to me at any time, the sounds of cars, the people-shaped blurs getting closer, or are they? The inescapable beam of sunlight on my face... Somehow even the wind carried shards of familiar feelings, like seeing things in the shadows out of the corners of your eyes, but this was the ghostly fragments of a place hundreds of miles away, where I used to walk for hours a day.  


But anyways, I turned the street. Home. Good. Got inside. Washed my hands. Washed my hands again. Vaped my pods. Knew they wouldn't last, so I needed to do something soon. A few days later, and here I am, typing this.   


Not trying to sound like a sob story here. I hate making people feel bad. Just need to let someone know.  


I have considered just messaging every driver as soon as they accept the ride, but even if they say they're cool with that, I will still have anxiety about being left again. The best solution for safety and peace of mind is to pay for phone service.   


As for the nicotine addiction, well I'm out of pods again, and I can't pay my phone bill just yet, so I guess this will be quit attempt number... well, I forgot. Wish me luck!",A story of being stranded earlier this week

1614821963,Lyft,"Throwaway. I have been using lyft to get around for about 3-4 years now. Here recently I’m not sure what’s been going on in the app, but calling a ride takes forever to pair with a driver. Lyft Pink also seems to be making the prices for rides I’ve taken to work before wayyyy more expensive. But to top things off Lyft is getting out of line for the authorization charges. I was under the impression that they authorized a charge once and dropped it. That’s not what’s been happening on my end. For someone reason ever since I’ve gotten Lyft pink every time I call a ride it authorizes my card for said ride, fine by me cause I’m paying the price for a service. What’s not fine with me is the simple fact it takes forever to even pair with a driver and times out a majority of the time. Whenever it the ping times itself out, the temporary charge sticks on my pending transactions and remains there with the money frozen. The other morning I had to ping a lyft 6 separate times and every single time I pinged and it timed out I got charged for it. I watched the money drain out of my account just from the pending transactions and it’s actually caused me to go into the negative because it’s charging for the ride and then keeping the pre auth charges. The same thing happened to someone else I know that uses Lyft and I just want to know if this is something new they’re doing or an update to the app that’s maybe a glitch? I think it’s ridiculous if they’re doing it that way now because you can have barely enough to get to and from work until your paid that night, but with the BS pre auth charges your stuck with pending charges and then actual charges for the ride. Also, has any other PAX experienced this lately?

1614369978,Lyft,I haven’t done my first drive yet but before I do I was just curious about one thing...what if someone wants to go through a drive through for food? Are we allowed to do that? I looked through the rules and haven’t found anything...how does that work?,Hello! New Lyft driver here with a question!🙃
1614358989,Lyft,"So this happened last year. I was doing a bit of driving before heading to my girlfriend's house. I got a ping for some guy named Jesus Garcia (On the app it showed in all caps: JESUS). As I approached the area, I got a text from his asking me to ""please do not honk your horn"" and I responded ""ok"". Once I got to the address, he sent me another message ""please come to the unit nextdoor, do not honk your horn!"" Once again I said ""okay"" and waited a bit. Within a few minutes, I see this big rotund Latino man walk out from around the house. He got in and thanked me for not honking the horn. He said the address that he set it to was not the actual address of where he wanted to go, he just wanted to be driven to the local liquor store and back to the pick up location. I am usually a nice guy and oblige to these kind of favors since Lyft isn't my day job and I kinda just do it for fun to meet interesting people. Well this guy proceeds to tell me that he is living with his sister's family and he's in the garage unit because he got a DUI and is on probation for alcohol. At this point I asked him if he should really be getting some alcohol since he mentioned his family would be furious if they found out he was still drinking. But hey its none of my business, so we get to the liquor store. He comes back out with a couple schnapps and we head back. He thanked me with a dollar bill tip, all crinkly and moist and gross, I think there was like dried blood on that one. I ended up stuffing that dollar in the corner of the door-side compartment for a real emergency, didn't even want to be bother to touch it.

So I drop him off, he's happy with his alcohol, I'm feeling terrible for enabling some poor alcoholic who can't get his life together. Anyways, none of my business I'm just a driver... So I get to my girlfriend's house, spend the night there with her. Finally it's time to leave and I still had some driving left in me so I headed down to the more popular area in my city. On the way, I turn on my Lyft app, and whaddyaknow.. the first ping I get is for Mr. JESUS! He had already finished his drinks and was requesting another poor driver to go through that ordeal. Suffice it to say I cancelled on him and went further away to some normal riders to end the night. I think he popped up once more for me a few weeks later, no way Jose! I mean Jesus!",Guy needs to get his drank on!
1614344846,Lyft,"I used to be super irresponsible behind the wheel and I also have bipolar disorder which wasn’t medicated at the time so I would just go bonkers behind the wheel. I got a ticket for passing traffic on the grass median on a highway before and a few speeding tickets along with two careless driving tickets for doing dumb things. 

However, all of these incidents happened 2.5 to 3 years ago. I haven’t had a single incidence since. I started medication 2 years ago and feel completely stable and I’m a great driver now. Now you can’t even tell I have bipolar disorder and I manage my life so well despite everything! I’m proud of that. 

What are my chances of being able to drive and work for Lyft and use their car? I have a Mazda Miata which is a 2 seater roadster so it won’t work for Lyft or Uber or any ride sharing service. Should I not even bother?

What are my other options?","I’m thinking about renting out a car through Lyft and working for them. The thing is, I have two careless driving records and some other offenses. Will this disqualify me?"

1614304649,Lyft," Eff  Lyft, eff Lyft, then eff Lyft some more. Ill try to make this short but  its gonna take me a bit to explain everything so bare with me. Ive been  driving for Lyft for about 2 years before covid. Once covid hit, it  dramatically decreased my rides. I was also driving pax to testing sites  without any heads up at all. Thanks Lyft. I also wasnt given any  protection or anything from Lyft while I was still driving. So I decided  the smart thing to do was to apply for PUA. I applied at the end of May  and got accepted in June. PUA had already gave money out before I was  accepted so luckily I got all the money prior to me being accepted,  which is amazing, I wasnt expecting that. It ended up being $4,000,  which is a lot to me. A couple months go by and I continue to paid  through PUA.

Then without notice I  stop receiving payments at the start of August. I have no idea why I  stopped getting paid, nothing changed. I call PUA and they give me this  BS excuse and say they have to do a background or something and it will  take a few weeks. 3 weeks go by and I call back, this time I am told it  will take between 45 and 60 days. I call back a week after the 60 day  period. This time im told it will take between 45 and 60 BUSINESS DAYS.  WTF, WTF WTF. EFFF LYFT. 60 business days go by and I call, this time im  told no one shouldve given me a time frame and they dont know when ill  start receiving payments. Really? This whole process is BS. No one at  PUA knows what they are doing.

At  the end of November I finally receive an email. Apparently I dont work  in the state I applied for PUA and now I owe $13,000. OMG I cant believe  it. Theres no way I can afford this. What the hell happened?  Im  seriously about to break down and start crying, I cant believe it. So I  decide to appeal the decision. I  send in all the documents I have  proving that I work in the state I applied for PUA in. Luckily I could  just take screenshot of bunch of rides on the Lyft website. I also took  screenshots of some tax docs showing I paid taxes in the state I applied  for. So then in January I have to talk with someone over the phone to  do the appeal. She sees all the docs I submit and I explain what  happened, why Im not working, how covid affected how much money I make  and all the other typical questions. It will take 2-4 weeks to make a  decision. 5 weeks go by and no answer. If I dont get this reversed Im  going to owe $13,000.

Finally,  today I go on the PUA site just for the hell of it and I WON  the  appeal. I am so excited. I immediately check my bank account to see if  the money went through. I have an extra $10,000. OH my God I cant  believe it. This is unreal. The last few months have been awful. Im not  working, i havent got any money. Ive been applying every week for PUA  not expecting to get any money. I seriously cant believe it. So this is a  message to anyone else in a similar situation. Keep applying to PUA. It  may take a while to get your money or you may have to appeal but keep  waiting you will get your money. I wouldnt be surprised if the  government is trying to make this a hard process so people will give up  and move on. Dont give up, keep fighting. If I can do it, you can too!  And anyone who is still driving, be safe and wear protection. Anyone  could have covid. Good luck everyone, be safe. Thanks for reading","Dont Give up on getting PUA, Dont Give Up!!"

1613916880,Lyft,"So overnight, this was like 2 am, saturday night, so literally a few  hours ago, I went to go pick this person up, lets call her Cierra. I drove past the person and was waiting for the person to walk to my car cause they saw me pass them. While I was waiting, this couple, not sure if it was a couple, really really drunk girl who can barely stand with another guy, sober was holding her up, opens my back door, saying i'm their driver.   


This girl and guy said i cancelled their ride, that I was there Honda accord who cancelled on them. Here i am, in a Toyota Rav4, saying ""thats not me, i drive a toyota not a honda"". So as any PAX would, they get angry that i'm lying about what my car model is (literally says on my driving wheel and touch screen ""toyota"") what they said it is. After a minute of saying they got the wrong driver, guy who's holding the drunk girl gets violent, comes inside my vehicle, starting the threats. 

""hey i'm gonna beat your ass you cancelled on me, your the honda accord why did you cancel, i should knock you out right here and now""  


Me, whos very confused, saying to the guy, i'm not the driver your waiting on, i'm someone else, i tell them i'm waiting for Cierra who i'm picking up. Now the drunk girl is saying shes Cierra. So to cut all the nonsense out, i call my passenger through the app, a WHOLE DIFFERENT person picks up, the drunk girl and guy present with her, their phones dont even ring, and as i'm on the phone with the passenger i'm supposed to pick up shes on the other side of the car telling the 2 people who are threatening me to leave. Also the crazy dude who was threatening me kicked my car door and slammed my door rather hard.

Crazy night, oh man, reminds me to keep my doors locked even in public places full of tourists cause some people are willing to get violent infront of cameras that will capture them in 4K HD 60 FPS, and then these people that start nonsense will show up in court and say ""thats not me""   


But this also made me think on why this man got violent.   


1. The girl was extremely drunk, he was holding her up, he might been trying to get her back to his place for the easy drunk smash.  

2. He a simp, start fights for her, to show his love, easy simp points  

3. Too drunk to tell the difference between honda accord and toyota rav4

1612822437,Lyft,"I've been trying for over a year and a half to actually get a direct response from Lyft customer service to discuss my suspended account. It was reported vindictively by someone who was a compulsive liar. They gave me their card number once for a ride home from a bar, then accidentally forgot the number was still defaulted and used it one other time. They got mad about this and I'm assuming they reported me as having stolen their card. 

They kept telling me that they never meant to get my account suspended, they just had to contact Lyft about the charge to their card to get it reversed and it was Lyft's decision to suspend my account. They kept saying they'd contact Lyft to explain and they never did. Then they left my state, and were publicly outed as being a pathological liar who has lied about everything from small things such as this to faking a terminal illness, scamming dozens of people in our group of friends. 

I keep opening the app, submitting a support request, and hoping I can talk directly to a person to explain this, but all I get are help desk form messages saying that the person who reported me has to contact them and they can't disclose any other information about why my account was reported for legal reasons other than to say it's a terms of service violation. So, I don't even know exactly what was said to report me or the reason (aka lie) that was given. 

Even if I did get to speak directly to someone, I'm not sure what I could do to prove it. The only evidence I have is a screenshot of a Facebook post made by one of our friends calling out the person about lying about a huge variety of things, and it includes their name, but I don't know if that would be taken seriously or not.

1611659512,Lyft,"Yesterday afternoon I get an email from Lyft that a driver reported me for not following the COVID health policy. This surprised me as I always follow the proper protocol when using Lyft and never had complaints. This notice also came two days after my last ride. Upon inquiring more with Lyft, I get told that the violation had to do with me not wearing a mask and having a large group of people in the vehicle(forcing the use of the front seat). Lyft did not give me any information about what trip this was referring too or any other useful information.

This allegation is completely false. Not just because I’m always compliant with COVID protocols but also because I haven’t used Lyft with anyone but myself in years. 

I think the reporting driver either mistook me for another passenger or made this up. Two days ago a driver cancelled on me after a minute into his arrival/waiting (I was on my way out too meet him when I got the notification). I thought that was odd but didn’t dwell too much on it. Another driver quickly replaced him and life moved on. Now I’m wondering if maybe the driver who canceled put “safety violation” as his reason for it in order to avoid a fee? Do drivers get charged for canceling after arriving? And would doing something like this, negate that?

Anyway, I don’t think Lyft will do much to fix this mistake as they can’t even tell when/which trip all of this supposedly occurred. But I am wondering what effect this will have on my record as a passenger. Will this violation limit my rides? Will other drivers see that I have this crap on my profile? How many of these strikes lead to an account suspension and for how long?(just so I have a better idea of what’s going on and to expect moving forward).

Thanks in advance:).",I wrongly got a health violation warning with a threat for suspension. Am I now flagged in the system? How will this effect my standing as a passenger? How many are people allowed to have?

1610769391,Lyft,"Just some info for anyone who drives for Lyft or is considering driving for Lyft.

1. You will pay taxes (hundreds to thousands more) on money you didn't earn, and money you spent for express pay fees. Lyft forces you to pay taxes on their expenses (Lyft platform fees, Services fees, Third-party fees) and then try to trick you by including these expenses into the total Gross earnings. So, if you hypothetically earn $6000 in what Lyft defines as gross earnings plan on paying taxes for $10000. Yeah, it's that much more... 
2. Lyft claims to take very little from faires, when in fact takes up to 70% of the fee charged to the passenger - hence the 40% average extra tax income liability. You must pay taxes on all of this! 
3. Lyft customer service is a complete joke, but this is common knowledge.
4. Lyft is denying official tax documents to drivers who earned less than $20,000 in 2020. Official tax documents are required to be given by law by an employer to any contractor who earns more than $600 in the given year in the employer's employ. Lyft will not admit to denying this legal paperwork and if you try customer service they will simply keep copy/pasting impersonal responses with instructions how to get unofficial paperwork. Lyft drivers should get ready to join another class action law-suit around it and other tax issues. If you have the sad misfortune of being investigated by the IRS the unofficial tax documents Lyft provides will not be accepted, and the burden will be placed on you to collect official tax documents, meaning you might have to pay a lawyer thousands just to survive a general audit (everything including Lyft earnings) on earnings netting less than $15000. \*\*\*Official tax documents are needed to validate PUA (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance) payments in many states, and Lyft is aware many of the drivers are using unemployment and not working for them, helping stem the spread of Covid. They want to make it as hard as possible for their drivers to collect unemployment. This is major a reason for denying tax documents to drivers. Very caring in a pandemic ridden world...\*\*\*
5. Lyft operates in a very non-transparent fashion. You never know what is going on behind the scenes or why they make the many changes that negatively effect passengers and drivers. Instead they use insincere wording and information exclusion in their media to engineer what drivers, passengers, and shareholders see and don't see. I understand companies do this, but most do not do this to the extant that Lyft does. 
6. If you use their rental car affiliations you will effectively earn less than $7.00 per hour while you're on the road, while adding another horrible dimension of BS you will have to deal with in your Lyft ventures. They make it seem like a lucky break for someone without a vehicle but in fact financially rape you. This is Lyft's worst scam. 
7. Lyft has been targeted by numerous law suits for lying to investors, using tax-law to force drivers to pay Lyft's taxes for them by simple contract concession, and for lying about the potential profitability of their business model. Lyft is an evil corporation.
8. The elite of Lyft corporate society continue to bank millions while screwing their shareholders, employees, and customers. They now seek to profitably break the law knowing they are mostly immune individually, and privately acknowledging they know the company will fail. The corporate Lyft elite are stuffing their pockets before deserting a ship they're purposefully sinking.

I gave him my friend/neighbor's phone number to coordinate a drop off where I live and I told him I would tip him double the $15 fee for his trouble. Driver texted my friend a screenshot of the gps being in route, my friend said ""ok, great let me know when you're 5 minutes away"".  
My friend proceeds to take a shower and misses a call from the driver 5 minutes later. Driver asks why he didn't answer and my friend says he ""was in the shower my bad, can you turn around?"" I guess he thinks we were screwing with him and he said no.  
I told him I can't even order a lyft without my phone much less coordinate a drop off and be in constant communication like he requires. Forbid I go to a local store to meet him and I can't message him, he'll just cancel again. I gave him my apartment complex address and he said ""I'll let you know when I'm on my way, I usually start my lyft route at 11 PM.""  
He asked me not to message him until then and I agreed and didn't.  
I said ""okay thank you so much"" and he never called or texted me, it's 12 AM and he's unresponsive. I messaged him twice now saying if he could bring it to me tomorrow I'd greatly appreciate it, again because without a phone I can't schedule a pick up. I guess my only remedy is to tell him to drop it off at a police station and I pick it up there?   
I understand it's my fault for leaving the phone and he has no obligation to return it, but he had agreed to return it and changed his mind 10 minutes into the highway because my friend didn't answer one call? Like I want my phone I'm going to be there, worst case when you get to the apartment complex you drop it off at the leasing office. I guess it was my mistake having my friend communicate on my behalf and should've just given him my google number from the start.  
After turning back I asked the driver if he could please come back and make the drop off, The driver was like ""i'll let you know when I'm on the way"" ""I said okay thank you so much, what time?"" he said ""I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I""M ON THE WAY""  
I said ""Okay man, but I don't have a phone, I can only see these messages when I'm at my desktop""  
He said ""well you're going to have to just sit there until I let you know"" I checked my PC every hour or so and had the volume on speakers up.

So I asked Lyft, you want me to go see a doctor for the SOLE purpose of having my Lyft reactivated? Because I sure as hell don’t need one for work in a hospital where I work as a doctor. They said they don’t know what to tell me, that that’s their policy. I emailed them our OH covid return-to-work policy stating exactly what I told them, and they said it wasn’t sufficient. It needs to be a “medical clearance.”

They are asking me and one of my colleagues to waste our time so that they can check off a box on their computer to allow me to use their services to go to work, at a hospital, when the pandemic is about get to get bad again.

1606850831,Lyft,"Has anyone run into this situation?

I live in a major metro area, about 20 minutes south of a state line, where the city is on the other side of the river. Lyft for unknown reasons, groups me in a driver area with a smaller city, one full hour south of me, and I am not considered part of that metro area by any sane or sober person. 

Lyft support says I meet all the driver requirements to drive in the area to my north, but I have to pick one or the other. If I have to choose, I'm picking keeping as-is because Uber doesn't offer ride filters, and having that option for my last ride home after I hump back across the river is nice to have. 

But why do we have to choose? It isn't for legal reasons - Uber doesn't have that restriction, and Lyft support says I meet requirements to drive in either. 

And here is the big pita factor.... I commonly get 2 rides into a streak, and then the 2nd ride takes me up into the city to the north,and then the app auto-logs me off. If I end up in the northern suburbs, no way am I driving 30 miles back in traffic for $15. I've submitted a ticket on this matter and one, but lately Lyft support isn't answering tickets on streak bonuses per other threads. 

So the whole driver area appears to just be a stupid policy that hassles drivers, and costs Lyft money. After all, there are probably a ton of metro areas on a river that is split between two states.",Lyft driver regions - stupid policy/setup

Do some drivers pretend to be deaf to avoid conversation or get pity tips?  Or not tell Uber/Lyft fearing discrimination or other detriment? 

Because the first time she picked me up, she made ""noises"" and gestures that indicated she was deaf.  But the second time to take me back home I could swear she said my name perfectly while I was still getting in with groceries and then she looked at where we were going and looked back and slight hesitation, she did the ""noises"" and gestures (that didn't sound anything like ""I'm deaf"" or point to her ears or mouth, just a twirling motion with her hand around the head again) that led me to believe she was deaf (again).

Bonus pessimism: She had Google (or whoever) Voice Driving Assistant on for both rides.  And she was parked under an overpass where there's nothing else for 300 yards except a large homeless encampment that is known to me personally as a druggie camp and her car had that kind of ""runner"" type vibe to it (it was kinda ratty, among other things).

I  reviewed your ride and can confirm that you were not overcharged. When  you requested the ride we quoted you a price of $9.99 and this is the  total you were charged.  


The cost of your ride will always be the  same as the upfront price unless the destination changes or a stop is  added. In this case, there was an **$8.54** charge due to an inefficient route. So, **$8.54** the was added to **$9.99** that why it came up with **$18.53.** Good thing is, the app automatically refunded the **$3.54** that's why the total charge was **$14.99.**

Their app has been doing this more and more frequently and now I'm 100% certain it's not just a glitch in the app. Because of course, they never honor the streak when you contact them. Instead you get some canned response that's basically better luck next time.

Then, on November 11th I took a ride with Lyft for $14.30. I also did not get charged for that ride until November 13th, I was charged four different amounts of $14.30 on that day, all for the same ride. 

I contacted support and they told me these were “authorization charges” and would just post as pending until the actual charge had fully processed, however all 8 of the charges have processed, totaling to $92.20 all fully taken out of my bank account and paid to Lyft.

LYFT IS NOT REFUNDING ME. 
they told me to dispute the charges with my bank, my bank has to close the account and It’s under investigation for the next 2 weeks. I am out nearly $100 for the next TWO WEEKS.

1605361052,Lyft,"So I started driving for Lyft recently, I used a PROMO code for $1,300 guaranteed if I do 125 rides on the first month. I understand that if you do not make the $1,300 when you meet the number of rides, they will pay the difference. My question is,

If I reach 125 rides and do not meet the $1,300; but I decide to keep driving and end up getting there anyways. Does that make the promo useless? Or would they make up the difference of my first 125 rides, regardless of what I earn after that? 

Should I stop driving once I reach 125 rides, and wait for them to pay the difference? I'm not trying to cheat the system, but based on my calculations, if my average remains the same, it would take a LOT more than 125 rides to earn $1,300. 

I'm very new, so I'm still learning about peak hours and hot spots. I am hoping that once I get a better feel for everything I can average more.

**Free Grubhub+ membership -** Get free delivery from your favorite restaurants ($9.99/month value).

**Relaxed cancellations -** We’ll cover 3 cancel fees every month if you rebook within 15 minutes.

**Bikes and scooters -** Get 3 free 30-min classic bike/scooter rides or discounted ebike rides every month (limited availability).

**Additional surprise offers -** Get seasonal discounts and exclusive savings (like airport deals).

**Priority airport pickups -** Get picked up faster at airports when it's busy.

**Waived lost and found fees -** Leave something behind? We’ll take care of the return fee every time.

Also sorry for the long post... I really don’t know what to do!

I should also note: I ALWAYS wear my face mask anywhere I go, My mother-in-law and my boss are both immune compromised, so I always keep their health in mind.

I live in Ottawa, and after stopping at the grocery store I decided to order a Lyft. 
Once the driver arrived, I asked him to open the trunk so i could put my groceries in there and then got into the car. After exchanging hellos, and asking him to put on his face mask, I put my ear buds in just because I’m not that social of a person. It was only a 4 minute drive from the grocery store to my house, I had about $100 worth of groceries that were for Thanksgiving dinner that I was heading home to prepare. 

Once we arrived at my house I got out and IMMEDIATELY the driver sped off, I had to chase after him to get him to stop so I could get my groceries out of the trunk. Once he stopped he says that he forgot that there were groceries in the trunk. I don’t say anything and wait for him to unlock the trunk.

Once unlocked, I grab all my groceries in my arms in one go, it really should of been 2 trips, but I didn’t know if the driver would speed off again. I did not have a way to close the trunk since my hands were full, so I was crossing the street to put the bags down. As I was crossing he started calling me a stupid man and an idiot because I left his trunk open. At this point I’m fuming, my neighbours are outside and this guy is causing a commotion. I say, oops I forgot to close it, looking down at my hands full of groceries. He continues to call me a stupid man and an idiot and says I will pay for it, getting out of his car and closing his trunk. Little did he know, if he let me put down the bags of groceries I would of been able to go shut the trunk.

As soon as I put my groceries away I sent a message to Lyft letting them know about this drivers unprofessional behaviour. No response, for 5 days.

I get a notification from my bank card that a transaction had tried to go through for an $80 damage charge. No email regarding what trip the damage is from, or anything. I sent out a message to the support team asking them what is going on.

I received an email back letting me know a driver made a claim that I damaged their vehicle. They sent the date and time of the ride, and pictures of the damage.

There was vomit in the car, and it looked like it was nighttime when he took the pictures.

I responded letting them know that it could not of been me within a 4 minute ride and where I was sitting in the car would physically not make any sense.

They are not looking into it any further they’re taking the drivers word over their customers...

They haven’t even looked at MY claim of the driver speeding off with my groceries and then having a huge fit when I couldn’t close the trunk.

I removed all my methods of payment from their app, and will be deleting it once they get back to me.

I just want to preface this saying I myself drive for Uber, DoorDash, GrubHub and Postmates, and thought that this experience reflects on the entire rideshare community poorly.

So here’s the story:
Submitted a request for a 45 minute ride (roughly 27 miles or so) because my car is currently in the shop. Driver shows up in a reasonable amount of time (about 7 minutes five or take). The moment I get in his vehicle he whips out of the parking lot onto a extremely busy highway, nearly getting into an accident within the first 30 seconds of the ride because he forgot to stop at the stop sign. Then we begin the ride, this man instantly is going over 80mph in a 45 zone and is weaving in and out of traffic, slamming on his breaks every minute or so. He’s tailgating, speeding and even weaving in and out of traffic for the entire ride. On multiple occasions he cut people off or even pushed people out of their lane by merging into the lane they currently are in. I think the cherry on top was the fact he completely cut off a ambulance that had its lights and sirens on. Then, at the end of the ride he has the audacity to be using his phone to text and even login to the Uber app, while currently on another ride.

1602824507,Lyft,"So I have been taking Lyft for about a year and my last ride was from an older gentleman no issue, but for my state i was reading that drivers self-report their mileage and inspections. 

Which brings me to, as a passenger, when the car first pulled up there was a bit of screeching coming from the bottom of the car and when I got in I saw the check engine light was on.

Even some of the people who I was with were saying there’s no way that car was a Lyft and if anything you have steel toed boots take it off and use it if you need to, that’s how sketchy it was.

I’m not one to judge especially during these hard times I know sometimes people can’t afford to repair something simple or expensive. 

But as the ride continues he was speeding whether he noticed or not I was looking at the dashboard and it was always between 70-80. There were several times where I felt like the car was going to give up in the middle of the freeway.

1602521964,Lyft,"Over the weekend we had what was the worst rideshare experience of my life. This was SO bad that it made the family guy meme seem tame. Lyft's support was an absolute joke so I'm sharing this on social media because it's the only thing I know to do.   


We booked a simple ride for 3 of us about 4 miles away. The funny thing is one of us actually drives for Lyft and has 4.9 stars.  


From the moment the car pulled up we saw red flags and should have honestly ran. The driver informed us that he doesn't transport 3 riders. I told him the app price for $20 includes space for 3 drivers and he raised his voice that HE doesn't do 3 but do we want his help or not so I said okay and got in the car. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because his English was so bad.   


As we are driving away I realize my seatbelt in the middle doesn't work. I've never ridden without a seatbelt once in my life. I jokingly text my friends to hold me if we crash because my selt belt doesn't work. My friend responds that hers also doesn't work. I thought it might be okay this once since it's the country and not much traffic - I was very wrong.   


He then stopped and informed us his phone was slow and demanded to know how to get there. We had no idea! Luckily my one friend had recalled the general direction.  


From there his driving was terrible. Weaving through traffic and speeding. I then noticed his eyes and could tell he was stoned off his ass. Made us feel incredibly unsafe but due to his aggression earlier were not comfortable asking him to stop and let us out in the middle of the road. I saw his license plate # in the app and should have took a screenshot.  


Three times during the ride random instructions blared out of his loud ass after-market speakers so loud I thought my ears would burst. He apologized and blamed the app and it happened 3 more times.   


My friend who is basically broke and we were actually there to help pay to get her car fixed insisted on paying so I was pissed and called Lyft right there after the ride (as well as reporting in the app). I explained that our driver appeared intoxicated, the seatbelts didn't work and asked for a supervisor. I also informed him we would be calling 911 and reporting the driver. He told me he can't issue a refund so I asked for a supervisor which he told me he would have call me back. I got pissed and asked if he understood there is  Lyft driver riding around high with no seatbelts driving like a maniac but he didn't care at all. I told him that if he didn't connect me with a supervisor I would be calling the authorities and reporting the car and I would also inform Lyft of the actions taken. He said in a rude way ""That isn't how this works, do you want a call back or not"". I told him fine.

We check the app and discover that we can no longer see the driver plate in our history. We called 911 though and reported the incident.   


One hour later we get a call back from the SAME GUY. He informs us that since we completed the trip he can only offer us 50% off. At this point I am now irate and tell him he might as well be telling me to go fuck myself. I told him I wanted a supervisor and he said there is none on the floor. I ask if he understands that we just rode in a vehicle with an intoxicated driver who scared the shit out of us, we were not comfortable demanding he stop in the middle of the busy road. He did not care. He offered no apology at all or actions taken against the driver. When I asked for the plate # so I could call back the police he refused to give it to me citing ""privacy concerns"". I told him that if he refused to refund the full amount I would contact the corporate office and inform them of what occurred as well as OSHA as we had 3 witnesses. I told him I would relay all this to corporate and that the call was being recorded and we had the time-stamp of when we spoke to him. He said do whatever you want, hung up on us and did not refund 50% even. I guess he did not fully grasp my tenacity.   


Today I tried calling corporate only to discover you can't get in touch with corporate relations. The number literally reads off some bullshit about using the app and hangs up.   


So I am going to get this out there until Lyft either pays my broke friend back her $20 (she wouldn't accept my cash app to pay) and issues an apology - REGARDLESS of this I will also almost certainly be contacting the BBB as well as dialing OSHA and reporting the incident as well as the recording of the call.","Worst rideshare experience of my life (high driver, 2 seat belts broken, driving erratically) - Sharing all over social media."

1602450323,Lyft,"This is a pet peeve of mine and I'm posting here to see if somebody can give me some insight into why this happens. Posting this on both Lyft and Uber communities to get both responses.

I've been using Lyft and Uber for 4 years and have almost a thousand rides combined (on both platforms).

About a quarter of those rides are Lyft Lux Black XL or Uber Black SUV. Almost all of my US rides had the following two in common:

1. Driver did not open the door for me to get in and get out
2. Drive was not dressed in business or business-casual attire. That is, driver was wearing shorts, t-shirt, and/or jeans.

One question. Why?

These services are replacements for the traditional black car service offered by limo companies. Those drivers will hold the door open and dress in business attire. In fact, the description of these services on Lyft and Uber's websites mention ""high end,"" ""premium,"" ""quality,"" etc. Anytime I've asked Lyft and Uber why their drivers don't imitate limo car drivers, the answer I receive is that it's about the vehicle, not the driver. Which doesn't make sense to me. I'm paying a premium price for a premium experience, not just the seven year old SUV coming to pick me up.

And just so you know, I have tried Uber Black (no Lyft outside US/Canada) in other countries and those drivers dress and act exactly like traditional black car limo drivers.",Why don't Lyft Lux Black XL and Uber Black SUV drivers dress professionally?

Almost to her destination, it adds another person. Get her dropped off and head to the second rider thinking, maybe she's going back into town and it'll get me closer to where I'm trying to be.

1602283649,Lyft,"I parked my car along a street that is not busy for a few minutes, after which it struggled to turn over and didn't quite start. Popped the trunk to get the voltmeter, knowing this car needs at least 12.2 volts to turn over successfully, and it registered 11.4 volts. 

I used a quick and unconventional method, which is to call a lyft, and inform them in the driver notes and with a message of the situation:

-That I need a jump start 
-That I have jumper cables
-That I have a cash tip
-That I do not need a ride

That way if they do not accept this unconventional situation for whatever reason, they are readily able to choose another ride.

Several rides dropped my request, usually after reading the notes and not wanting to for some reason, which is part of this set up.

A woman sort of far away accepts it and does not drop the request, even with a 13 min drive to reach me.

She arrives, I have 4 dollars in quarters, on top of a 1 dollar bill on my car, jumper cables on top of my car, hood popped, and ready to go.

She pulls up, I have a mask on, I wave and she doesn't wave back. 

Its a middle aged woman with thousands of rides under her belt. 

I get the money as she pulls up hood to hood with my car, and walk towards her with it in my hand offering it to her before she even does anything. 

Respectful to ease any concern of not getting paid or any mistrust someone might have at an unusual request.

She waves her hand at me, and rudely says ""No, I don't need your change"".

I ask if she is sure and she just waves her hand at me again, saying ""You've already wasted my time, no."" As she pops her hood. 

I ask her if she has done this before of if she'd like me to hook the cables up. 

She says ""No, I've never done anything like this before""

""Strange"", I think to myself, but okay, at least Im getting a jump. 

She says ""you do know what you're doing right?"" 
I say yes dont worry you can trust me with this. 

She says ""no, no I don't trust you at all"".

Another flag goes up internally for me.. But I ride the waves, laughing and saying ""no you're right, actually you shouldn't trust me, that's smart of you."" 

She doesn't respond.

I get the cables, and she says "" you're sure you know what you're doing? You better not mess up my car.""

I briefly explain the concept to her as I hook them up, lifting the little plastic cover off her positive terminal.

I jump in my car and it starts right away. 

I unhook the cables and put them back in my car as she goes to slam her hood down on the plastic terminal cover which is still up. 

I go ""wait wait wait! Your plastic cover is still up!"" Saving her from thoughtlessly breaking it off while she slams her hood shut. 

She goes ""OH, well you could have AT LEAST done that."" 
As she shakes her head and closes the little tab herself, being very condescending and rude about her own stupidity. 

I gave her 1 star and an accurate review about her poor character and condescending manner.


She either didn't read the message or the driver notes, caused herself to waste her own time by refusing payment, caused another problem by almost breaking her terminal cover, and took each one of those self created problems out on ME, with little to no self awareness or self responsibility all throughout the process. 

I felt bad for knowing its an unusual request that might be off putting to begin with, and went out of my way to proactively smooth over every possible issue that arose. 

Yet still, was treated with inconsiderate hostility for the only part of the equation I was not responsible for, which is her own personal conduct. 

I don't get how fully mature adults can act like this.

1600682476,Lyft,"This weekend driving had two hand-to-forehead moments.  Just a quick chuckle.  Nothing earth-shattering.

Go to a bar for a pick up (not convinced social distancing was going on-with a line outside and all).  Girl stumbled out and asked if I was her ride.  Yes. “I have to get my friend.”  Shit we all know the friends want another drink first.  So after a few (last ride of a streak or I’d have said screw it snd left), they both come out.  So she opens the door and they start arguing sort of about who paid the bar bill.  In this case each wanted to pay the whole bill and one put in for half.  So not nasty.  So they stand there another few minutes.  Finally they both get in and go less than a mile to where they both were going.  That discussion that held me up took longer than the ride.  They could have just gone home and discussed.

Another last ride of the streak tonight-I roll up and swipe to pick up and see his destination is a mile from my house.  Sweet.  He opens the door-“my girlfriend had my wallet.  Can I call the police?”  Shit.  Well okay he asked one last time (her window was shouting distance from the sidewalk) and he decided to deal with it in the morning.  Maybe when everyone was more sober.

Writing this I realized and this can be the question-is it just me or is that last ride of a great steak always something wrong?  Drunks who get to their destination and decide to go somewhere else, the people adding stops Rn route, someone adding a new destination 20 miles away when you picked them up on filter, the gang with munchies, etc?

1600368649,Lyft,"Today I took a Lyft to work as usual. Everything was fine until the driver passed my destination. I didn't panic at first because it's normal for a driver to miss a turn every once in a while. The thing that made me panic was that the gps told him to make 3 turns that could get me to work, but he ignored all 3 and drove about 10 minutes away from my destination.

I made sure to remain calm and told him he drove too far out. He looked back at me, smirked, and said ""that's alright"". Then he noticed I was using my phone and decided to follow the gps instructions. He told me he was using the gps on his phone.  He pulled his phone from between his legs. It looked like he had an address entered in google maps because it was green. He behaved strangely the rest of the ride.

I'm not sure if he's telling the truth or was trying to take me somewhere else. If I never would have stopped him I'm not sure where he would have taken me.

1599930742,Lyft,"Let me share with you my recent experience of attempting to return a phone to a passenger. If you're a passenger, it might help you to know how the process (sort of) works.  
Yesterday morning, I hear the pinging of a phone that has been left, somehow, wedged between the console and the front seat by a passenger in the back seat on a previous ride. Fortunately, I have only had a couple of rides, and I know which passenger it belongs to, as the other passengers each had their phones in their hands when they got out. At the next stoplight, I fish the phone out and set it on the seat next to me. I am en route to my next ride, so I will report it missing after I have picked up and dropped off that passenger, which is what I do. Lyft has me fill out an online form under under that particular ride in my ride  history: description of the item and is it okay for the passenger to call me? I can tell you, I am reluctant to do this, because sometimes I have passengers who think having a Lyft driver's phone number means they now have a buddy who will come pick them up from the bar when they are broke. (Seriously, they want a free ride.) Normally, I just take the item to the Lyft hub where the passenger can go pick it up, but the hubs will no longer accept lost items because of COVID-19. (Which is really just a convenient excuse, because they also know what a hassle dealing with left items is.) So, I have started allowing passengers to call me on my personal number just to make it easier on them. When the item is returned, the passenger is charged a $15 return item fee (always) and the driver receives the $15 (usually.) I continue on with my morning, and eventually head home. No one has called me looking for the phone. I check my e-mail, and Lyft has responded to my lost item report and has forwarded my number to the passenger. Hours go by. No call. Passenger's phone has rung a couple of times, but I'm reluctant to answer someone else's phone. Eventually, I answer it. Not the passenger, but someone looking for him. I explain why I have the phone. Passenger's phone is locked, but text messages keep popping up. Texts indicate that the passenger may be a drug dealer. Phone rings again, and I answer it again. This time it *is* the passenger. I explain that I will be going back out in the afternoon, and I can bring him his phone then. I just need the address. (FYI: for your protection, your address disappears from my app the moment I drop you off, and unless I dropped you off at a landmark, I'm not going to remember where you got out. All the rides kind of blur together.) He won't give me his address (possible red flag, but maybe it's not his place) but gives me the intersection. I ask him for a number where I can reach him when I get to his neighborhood. He gives me a number, which I repeat back to him for confirmation. Twice. I Google the intersection to see if there's a gas station where I can stop and call him. There is, but I also get results of a whole lot of news articles about different shootings and murders that have happened at this intersection over the last couple of years. Well, I'm going before dark. I'll be fine. Just before 5 pm, I drive 25 miles and nearly 45 minutes (because of an accident on the highway) to get to the intersection. It's already not worth the $15 that I may or may not get, but I'm trying to be a nice guy. People need their phones. I call the number (that I confirmed twice, remember?) and it's a wrong number. I'm now a really pissed-off nice guy who decides to wait around to see if the passenger's phone rings again or if he calls me on my number, which Lyft has supposedly provided him. Nothing. I wait almost an hour and go home. Over 50 miles and nearly 3 hours of my time, and I have nothing to show for it.   
This is how returning items goes for me about half the time. I hate it when someone leaves something in my car. HATE IT. I feel guilty if I don't try to get it back to them, but it's almost never worth my time and effort. I'm sure other drivers have had similar experiences, so: if you have left an item in a Lyft, and you're having difficulty getting it back, please understand that this is among the worst parts of a Lyft driver's job.   
Here's your takeaway, passengers:   
1) Double-check that you have all of your belongings before you get out of the car.  
2) In the event that you DO leave something, make it as easy as possible for the driver to get it back to you, and give them a tip. The $15 return fee sometimes doesn't make it to us because of a ""glitch,"" and our time and trouble may be a lot more than what you see (and worth way more than the $15.)  


Post-script:  
If this guy eventually *does* call me (on MY phone, I'm not answering his anymore,) I will probably go ahead and ask him for a mailing address, buy one of those little bubble envelopes, and mail it to him at my expense. (And Lyft may or may not reimburse me.) He doesn't deserve it, but most of us who drive for Lyft really do care about our passengers (probably more than Lyft cares about you.)",PSA: Why Your Lyft Driver Isn't Being Helpful About Getting Your Belongings Back To You

I am a researcher at the University of Duesseldorf and I am conducting a scientific study about **improving the working conditions of drivers** of Ride Hailing companies and the latter's Algorithmic Management practices. **I would very much appreciate your participation by clicking on the below link:**

[**http://algorithmicmanagement.hhu-managementforschung.de/**](http://algorithmicmanagement.hhu-managementforschung.de/)

**The results of the study may be interesting for drivers** since they may help to show that **providing   more information about the assigned rides (e.g. expected pay and  destination) and the applied Algorithmic Management criteria (e.g. acceptance rates and customer ratings) may be beneficial** for both drivers and Ride Hailing companies. **I would be happy to share the results with this ridesharing community** after the study has been finished!

Also, **I will raffle four 30 Dollar Amazon vouchers** among all survey participants.

Please note that **this study is not conducted on behalf of any Ride Hailing company (e.g., Lyft, UBer etc.)**. It is a purely scientific, independent study.

**The study takes only 10 minutes** and is anonymous.

1597862469,Lyft,"I started driving for Lyft over two and a half years ago. I remember when I had my first issue with a fare and would simply just call from the ""help""  option in the app.  You'd get a  tasty lil message stating a LYFT representative will call you back shortly.  Two minutes later.  You get a call.  Explain the issue, and you either get it resolved or advised on the error.

Beautiful.

Today, I pick up a fare that was added to my trip home (destination ride).  I've done hundreds of these rides before, with no tissue. Once I drop the fare off at his destination, we both noticed that the ride has been cancelled. I did not select the cancellation, nor did the passenger. So what do I do?

I use the trusty (no)help feature.  The passenger waited with me oh, so he could verify the ride was complete, but there was no call. Just a lame cold text message option. I advised them that the passenger was still with me to verify the ride was complete. My app was still on, so they can see my location.

The robotic text response I received was: ""you canceled, we cannot track you, so we cannot pay you....this conversation has been closed"".


My blood pressure started to rise a bit. I tap the help option again. I explained the situation again, with more detail. Same robotic text response. Verbatim. So then I request to speak with a supervisor. The agent virtually refused to involve a supervisor. I literally had to threaten to deactivate my Lyft account over a measly $10, just off the principal. The agent response back, that ""a supervisor will be emailing you within 24 to 72 hours"".

I have never had this issue with Uber. When I reach out for support from Uber, I've gotten a person. I'm not sure I can allow myself to be fooled by the pretty pink colors anymore.

Or, with Uber this would be close to a $200 fare (which would be a life line right now!)  {side note, I had not driven a long drive with Flex Drive and Lyft yet}.  Quickly I accept and head to my pick up.
I arrive and the gentleman couldn't be more appreciative.  I help him load his luggage into the car and while buckling our seat belts, he makes sure to tell me repeatedly that he is ""going to leave a big tip through the app.  I don't know what I would have done, I am going to tip you big time!""

We arrive at his destination and he is going to the Celebrity Center as the Scientology building!  OMG!  I watched that whole Leah Remini series and if I had known our trip could have been filled with probing questions and lively conversation (i'm sure thats why he put on the the headphones).  I unload his luggage, once again he thanks me and says that he will have to put my big tip on the app because he doesn't have any cash.  Well, there go my big tip dreams so it's time to head back to Lancaster!
Now here is the fun part!  Of course it is starting rain and I have to make it out of downtown NYC on a Saturday night after my first time driving to NYC.  I make it out and with Celine Dion as my co-pilot, our journey had begun.  For those who don't know, if you travel out of state for a drop-off you cannot log back into the app until you reach the state in which you are licensed and insured.  However we reached the PA line and I didn't realize that I had also reached my maximum hours for the day again....12 hours....so I have to take a mandatory 6 hour consecutive break.  With Celine belting out the hits and me trying not to show her up with my singing skills ( ha ha ), we arrive home in cozy Lancaster, PA!  I was just as anxious as I could be to review my trip and see exactly how many hundreds of thousands of dollars I just made with my ride fare and my big tip!
$138 !!!!!!!!!
No, that can't be right!  Uber NYC trips were always right at $200 how can this be right.  I reach out to Lyft and it is confirmed that this is the correct pay-out for this trip $138....NO TIP!
Still, $138 I'm good with that!  That will finish up my weekly rental and almost leave me with enough to get a carry out Little Ceasers Pizza!  But even before I can smell the hot oven melted cheese, I realize that I can't even afford a $0.35 dipping sauce because of the ""new math!""  That's how I refer to all of the flex drive fees!
My weekly rental is $307 and that gives me 350 personal miles per week.  Which does sound like a lot until you realize how quickly and in how many ways those weekly miles accumulate.  With it being the end of the week, I was almost at the cap of my weekly mile allotment.  The moment your odometer hits 350.01 miles, there is a fee of $25 for an additional 50 miles.  The miles from Manhattan to the Pennsylvania line (where I could log back into the app and not be penalized for my mileage) is 95 miles.  Those 95 miles are considered personal miles.  And remember that I was almost at the 12 hour mark for driving for that shift????  BAM  another 70 miles to get to Lancaster that come off of my personal miles..  
On the way to the drop off, Lyft covers all of your tolls.  On the way back......you are responsible for the tolls.  That is another $40.85....but wait.....using the convenient  EZ Pass suppled by FlexDrive .....tacks on a 10% fee for using that service.  Now we are at $45 in tolls.

Here is the new math:  $138 paid (no big tip) deduct $45 tolls deduct $75 in extra mileage = $18

I know he was blatantly lying because he had started driving away from my pick up location and I had my mask on the entire time. Now Lyft is issuing a warning for me but I know I am not in the wrong here. 

Has this happened to anyone else and is there anything I can do to flag the driver?",Lyft driver claimed I wasn't wearing a face mask when he was nowhere near my pick up location

Longer rides benefit me because they’re good money and I have nothing else to do but make money right now. Thanks!!",Longer rides? HELP!
1596686941,Lyft,"Okay, so, get this:

I signed up for Lyft with my Google Voice number. Which they accept— it says so right on their help pages! So, the app sets up my account, and I request a ride. It gets to the moment that I need to pay, and I choose a credit card. The app tells me that that payment method is invalid and to try another.

I'm like.... ooookay. Select a different card. Again, invalid. What? So, I use my PayPal balance. Again, it's invalid. What?! How can a PayPal balance be invalid? I'm never able to get a ride.

I contact Lyft customer service and explain what happened. They reply by saying to make sure my billing information is correct. Yes, you read that right: They don't say anything about my VOIP number, but rather, tell me to check my billing information. Yes, I assure them, the address and everything else are valid.

I have one or two more rounds of back-and-forth with customer service like this— to no avail. I then email them, ""I know my payment information is accurate. Yesterday I was notified that my account was disabled. When I contacted customer support, I received a reply from \[So-and-so\] saying that after consulting with your risk team, he's unable to re-activate the account. I think what happened is that your system falsely flagged me as a hacker. I assure you I am real and can authenticate myself using any personal information you need. Can you pass me on to a senior customer-support specialist so that I can open a new account that will work?”

And then they ghosted me :-).

Oh, yes! So fun :-).

Soooo... filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Submitted a very diplomatic, polite report, laying out the facts. I explained that clearly, I was denied service because I was using a Google Voice number. Clearly, the “invalid payment” error messages were inaccurate; in truth, I had been blacklisted. I requested that either they remove my number from the blacklist or change their help page to indicate that they do not accept a Google Voice number. I also requested that in the future, when an account is suspected of being fraudulent, they *inform the user that that is the case* and offer them a means of clearing their name. (Because I really do want to help others!)

Now, let's pause here. Does anything I've said sound unreasonable? If you were a well-intentioned company who cared about customers, would you not take the time to speak with someone who insists, respectfully — through the BBB! — that they were flagged as a false positive?

Their response: ""\[So-and-so\] wrote in to Support on \[such-and-such date\]. Our agents were in correspondence with \[So-and-so\] shortly thereafter and informed \[So-and-so\] that we had found \[So-and-so\] to be in violation of our Terms of Service and had deactivated \[So-and-so's\] Rider account.

As \[So-and-so\] has been informed that we are unable to reactivate \[So-and-so\] account, we consider this matter resolved.""

Hello, a Californian here wanting to know how Lyft drivers want to be classified.

There is a prop this year in CA's election for determining if an Lyft or similar driver would be classified as an independent contractor or employee.

How do all you drivers feel about this? What status would you want?

I would assume you want want employee status with all the benefits that come with it.

However, I am aware of the benefits of being an independent contractor.

I feel it is unfair to decide the status of Lyft drivers since I am not in fact an Lyft driver.

1596514711,Lyft,"Pax had masks on as they entered my vehicle. As I pulled out and and lookedout my back window, both pax were wearing their masks on their chins. I politely asked them to wear their masks properly.  I explained a personal story of another pax who was taking care of her elderly grandma. She grilled me on my disinfecting habits and my adhering to protocols with mask. The guy behind me to my right says, ""we gotchyou man! We're cool with it.""   


Halfway through the 15 minute ride, I realize the same guy's voice was clear and not muffled. I looked back... Sure enuf! His mask was around his chin again. I motioned with my mask for him to put it on correctly and verbalized it too in a more assertive tone. And finally, one minute before arriving, the same guy spills his drink (smelled like alcohol). I started to say, alcoholic beverages aren't permitted...

When all of a sudden, the guy goes nuts! Out of nowhere, says, ""Alright, I've had enough out of you. You don't ever effin tell me what to do. Eff you and your masks with your governor telling me..."" He was next to my right ear with his voice and fingers. As I was in a rental car via hyrecar, i didn't have my dashcam set up. As he was in my ear, I had the wherewithal to turn on my iphone camera and start to record. His female comapanion warned her friend that I was starting to record. I feared for my safety. The act of starting to record go him to start to exit the vehicle. (note: Nevada is a one-party consent state for recording. I consent in this scenario. Now if I were to publish the asshat's rant and illogical outburst, both of us would need to consent. I think this is why neither company wants to see footage of our dashcams. They can't be shared in any state without express permission or only under a court order. But I digress...)  


Muscle boy exits the vehicle, SLAMS THE DOOR SO HARD THE BOTTOM PANEL broke free from the plastic rivets holding it in place. His female accomplice continues to sit in the car, taunting me and hurling obscenities and the finger at me as I record her. She gets out and doesn't close the door behind her. As I was pulling out, both were standing approx 20 ft in front of me, both giving me the finger. 

During the course of all this, another ride had pinged me. It was just around the corner. I picked them up. The couple noticed I was out of sorts (adrenaline was amped up). I didn't say much. I took them to their destination, turned off the app and wrote to ""Support"" what had just happened.

I turn my app back on, get pinged two times (for a $12 streak). As I'm approaching the drop off of the second ride, I noticed the streets are packed but I'm not getting any requests. I thought to myself, ""No... that rider made a fraudulent report against me?"" Sure enough, as I ended the ride, I got that message, ""your account is on hold. We are investigating a report of you violating our Community Guidelines"" Hindsight being 20/20, I should have forgone the $12 streak and written my synopsis of the guy's outburst out of nowhere.When I got home there was a detailed email. I'll put it in my comments. Who has had experiences of being put on hold / deactivated for no reason.   


I will say, I've had a spate of ""off rides"". I pre-empted two other rides that were red flags for me: A group of 4 mid-20s females wanted to all get in my car with the 4th sitting in the front seat. I explained that it wasn't possible during COVID and the app points this out clearly. They insisted. I said ""no"". The 4th sulked away and the three in the car just sat there the whole ride in a tone deafening silence and didn't say a word. My gut told me they were going to make up a story of how I did them wrong income way. I wrote Lyft explaining what had just happened. As I started my next day at 5a, a kid about 19 or 20 approached my car for his ride. Had a mask on, but as he started a video chat with g/f mid-ride, he takes it off. He's drunk and I thought it best to just let it go. It was only a 10 min ride. We get to destination, he exits my car and pulls out a beer from the door. He snuck it in the car! I didn't see it as he walked up. He also sat directly behind me, so I couldn't see  what was in his doorwell. When we arrived, he couldn't get the gate code correctly entered. But he insisted I wait until he did. As he was already out of the car and he only had 1/2 block to walk (I also had another pax waiting), I said, ""I have to go"" and drove off. I reported him for the mask and beer. The ""support"" person said his ""rating will not affect my 5 star rating..."" So, he definitely reported me. For what? (Not waiting for him to open the gate with the same code entry over and over? At one point, I tried also, but to no avail)

Before anyone says, ""you must have said or done something to get this reaction..."" STOP! The interaction went just like this: 1) They were lost when trying to find the pickup location. (L / U operate a little different here). 2) I called to give them directions on where to meet me. 3)  They arrive, I do my usual greeting,  verify where they are going 4) I start the ride and remind them to put on their masks properly 5) I explain grandma story and masks 6) Eight minutes into ride, I remind him to don his mask Just an aside, the two of them gossiped like two little old ladies the whole trip. At  one point, the woman says something about the ""Swiss Alps"". The meathead said, ""What's that?"" (meathead b/c he was definitely some kind of athlete in MMA or wrestling or something requiring him to wear a fluorescent green tank top to show off his pecs...)

Mistake #1, scheduled rides give you a false sense of security. If I live there and going to start work at the same time, I might take the $2. I was only there accepting any rides for the bonuses.

It wasn't a long wait and she even texted me that she'll be right there. She was well dressed and complimented my car and my safety measures. When I was pulling away, I noticed that the destination is just the name of a city. I followed the navigation anyway and was going to ask her at the lights or something. Mistake #2, if you have an important appointment, this is the worst mistake you can make.

I did the 1st turn, a left one. Immediately, she told me I was wrong, Google map was wrong, she casually threatened me with something about management, and demanded me to turn right immediately instead of left. She made 4 mistakes in 3 seconds!

Mistake #3, the driver is always right. #4 Give Google maps some patience or you risk being dumped in the middle of nowhere at 3 am. We can certainly do that. #5 I am technically an independent contractor and I cannot be fired. #6 I cannot turn right in the left lane - stupid directions. If I can, I will drive to the middle of nowhere before doing #4, dumping you.

So I immediately drove into a parking lot. My only intention was to figure out where she was going. But I had no chance to do that. She escalated the situation. I showed her my app that the address is wrong and I'm not wrong. She showed me her app that she did the right thing, which didn't concern me.

First, I was trying to tell her that I wasn't doing anything wrong. Everything could be wrong but me. She was combative and threatened my job before I could finish any sentence as if that could work. I could not admit to any wrongdoing, not for $2, so I waited patiently for her to finish.

She started screaming as if that could start my engine. She screamed and begged me to take her to an intersection that I have no clue about. #7, I don't live there.

If you give me a street address, I know that you know where you are going and I can enter it quickly via voice. Intersections are about the worse thing to search for; I have to know how to spell it or pronounce it and I had to do it twice.

Mistake #8, keep your cool even if you want to murder me. I can't drive with a screaming passenger, not even if I am like sitting at the front of a police car and you are like locked up at the back.

By now she was screaming like a high speed broken record #8, begging me to go #7, and threatening my job #5. I had to remind her that my recorders were on #9.

I repeated that I could take her there but she had to calm down before I could help and that I had no choice but to ask her to leave my car. She wouldn't leave and threatened to call the police, mistake #10. The police are our friends, really. We call them much often than you think. I'm actually the driver on record so I passed background checks - I have documents, I have no criminal records and I am no sex offender.  So I told her please do it, saving me the effort to explain to her that I had to call the police to get her out. Lyft may not want to look at my recordings but the police had to #9.

She asked me to delete the trip because she wasn't going to pay for it, got out angrily, and banged the door of course. I am happy to delete it because I didn't want to give her the chance to rate me for $2. But in the screaming confusion, I couldn't find the button and ended the trip instead. That gave her the time to go almost to ground level to take a front picture of my license plate as if that will do anything #5, #9, #10.

I texted the next rider that I had problems with the last rider and asked for a few minutes extra. Taking the time to write her up is my pleasure. (She tipped me cash for that.) I wanted to rate her and write her up immediately but changed my mind. I wrote her up after all the bonus rides are over.

1594697576,Lyft,"As anyone familiar with recent postings can recall, Lyft has been egregiously screwing Riders and driver's alike during this crisis. Poor people in low-income areas especially are getting absolutely slaughtered with high prices, having to order Lux rides to avoid paying 4x or MORE for a regular ride.

I have made multiple post with screenshots over the course of multiple hours, (and I have many more) that clearly show Lyft charging absurd 400%+ Surge rates to Pax, while ZERO PPZs will be present ANYWHERE on the map. 

At first, I thought my 8-month-ago analysis was correct and Complete - Lyft's algorithm was being used to herd drivers where they wanted them, and at least initially, ppz appearance and dollar value were tied more to this, than to handle and reimburse for supply and demand surges as they happened in real time.  I STILL think this is a large part of what the algo does - its all about manipulation of the map and assets - why else would you only show ONE box, with every driver getting their OWN, UNIQUE PPZ appearances?  Surge zones were designed to get drivers to move do the areas of highest demand; this radicalized version does that to the most precise degree possible, and on a very micro scale since it's applicable on a per-driver basis. 

HOWEVER - something clicked a few days back while I was waiting for PPZs to pop up.  It seemed to me that the earlier I went out, the longer I would have to stay offline before a PPZ would appear - and it also seemed to me that it all just ""STARTED"" at once, vs naturally gearing up, again, BASED ON ACTUAL DEMAND.   On day 6 of tracking this entire issue, and 2 days into trying to figure out how to get the PVCs to appear earlier, I was getting frustrated after sitting offline for 1 hour and 45 minutes while watching 500% surge rates being charged in MOST of the city.  All of a sudden, in the hood, a $25 PPZ appeared!  And then it was off to the races. 

Nothing of note happened the following shifts, and then today happened.  It had never dawned on me, I guess because initially it seems like a retarded hypothesis, to check and track the goddamn TIME.  Which I have now done. 

Granted, my sample size is small - less than 2 full weeks of shifts, and I've only repeated what I'm about to say TWICE - but I HAVE repeated it and it is super precise for it to be a coincidence LOL.  

In Atlanta, unless there is HUGE demand, or Lyft has some other method of modifying, PPZs will not appear until 7am.   At 7am, PPZs begin to appear around the $2.30 - $3.00 range, depending on where you are - if you are in the hood, those PPZs will skyrocket quickly - these Pax are getting raped the most, and I would assume Lyft once as many regular drivers in the area as possible, before the Pax gets smart and looks at the premium rides, thus the increased dollar amount.  Could this be changed day to day?  I'd put a kidney on it!  But right NOW, This is happening on a daily basis. While I was not paying attention to the time on the other days I have been tracking this unethical Behavior, I was able to figure this out SOLELY due to the fact that they appeared to all start around the same time on weekdays.  I do not recall this behavior prior to the pandemic, though I can't be sure tbh.   

At this point, PPZ appearance APPEARS to follow SOME level of a demand-based pattern, which is consistent with all of my prior experience.  However I will bet a kidney that this is FAR from the only variable, though it SHOULD BE.  

This is my main breakdown.  Nobody truly knows how the shit works, because that's how they want it. And while I'm sure there are MANY errors, I'm on the right track, I know it.  Some additional things to note: 

1) prior to the pandemic, if things were STUPID busy and PPZ rates were upper $20 and higher, rides thrown into your queue would ALSO show a bonus, giving you a false sense of fairness i guess?  Those bonuses were ALWAYS lower than what I would get if I just logged off, however.    NOW, though, I have yet to see this happen. Rides thrown into my queue during rush hour NEVER have a bonus, and I do mean NEVER.  But if I LOG off after the ride, as SOON as it processes the trip and returns me to ""waiting for trip"" mode, BOOM, a PPZ appears!   SHADY?  Lol naaaahhhhhh 

2) back when this ppz craft first started, occasionally during a busy time when for some reason a bonus was not added to a ride in my queue, an amount would be adjusted on the back end. This is actually PER LYFT'S WRITTEN (One of the few), STATED POLICY.   It didn't happen often, but it did happen.  I hadn't seen it happen in many months however, and the pandemic has NOT changed that.  When you know that I have packs is being charged 500%, and you have $0 of bonus, you kind of think that written policy might come into effect.  Lol Naaaaahhhhhhhh.


So I've drawn a couple of hypothetical conclusions...... It appears that the Lyft algorithm or AI or whatever, is practically broken. I think they had it tuned to always give them the house advantage when it comes to surge payouts, and now the pandemic has exacerbated that little nugget of programming, and they don't know how to fix it.  On top of that, I think they are ALSO intentionally fixing the board in various areas so that they are RAKING IT - guys and gals don't forget these companies had never profited a dime leading up to this pandemic, so it is highly logical to assume that this could have put them both under. However, about five or six weeks ago, I seem to recall they both stopped making a lot of noise. Remember, they were barking REAL LOUD, as they do, around the time that CARES Act was passed, so they could pass the buck on taking care of their drivers to the government, which is basically just putting it right back on the drivers of course lol.  

Q2 earnings should be interesting.  SPREAD THE WORD - UBER IS DOING IT TOO, they just aren't being NEARLY as evil with their drivers.  Probably because they aren't morons and can probably reprogram their algo when needed or something - Uber always has surge zones up, but every time my buddy has shown them to me, they have been 1 to $5, or other single digit amounts, with again the same 350% to 500% surge rates for regular passengers.  

Tweet this, share it, email it, I don't care - I don't run alt SM accounts, so I'm not keen to put my name on this at the moment.  I may start an alt, but I honestly don't really care about recognition; I'm looking for fairness and justice - I can assure everyone that as a lux driver, I'm still doing just fine thank you - but anyone stuck as a regular driver is getting screwed SO hard.  I can afford to wait for a PPZ - but I am NOT the common case by any stretch.  And once things get moving, it's REAL HARD to keep track of things to know how badly ur getting hosed.  

STAY VIGILANT AND GET THE WORD OUT!

It was a little too long for me, but I always appreciate long wires since you can easy just tuck it away in the trim and not have an issue with cable length, so that's a big plus. As for the power cable, I found that to be a little short by like 3 feet for a clean factory look, but doesn't look that bad as you only see the power cable when sitting in the passenger seat.

The Zenfox T3 came with all necessary hardware to get it going:

* Front Camera Quad HD (2560 x 1440P 60FPS) with the interior camera built in (1920 x 1080P 30FPS)
* Rear Camera Full HD (1920 x 1080P 30FPS)
* Main power cable (12V Lighter to USB mini-B)
* Inter-camera cable (USB mini-B to USB mini-B)
* 1 removable mounting bracket per camera with preinstalled 3M adhesive pad
* 2 extra 3M adhesive pads per mounting bracket
* A Micro SD to USB adapter
* Trim tool with one end being big with the other end being small, so 2 sizes in one.
* USB-A to mini-B cable
* User manual

The camera itself feels solidly built and feels like a premium cam, there are no flimsy parts in the joints. Video quality is amazing (Will post videos soon as my internet upload sucks) especially at night with both the front cam and the infrared interior cam. Easy to set up and get working. Manual was easy to follow and clear. (Not like those IKEA instructions which makes you pull your hair out). I did however notice that the unit did get quite hot and being in the summer heat doesn't help with that. The app that's used to connect to the camera is extremely straight forward and the best part is it DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO SIGNUP FOR AN ACCOUNT. (I brought one of those PUR water filter for the faucet and to use the app it makes you sign up for an account, which asks for your full name, gender, zip code, etc. That is extremely ridiculous especially for a WATER FILTER!)

Overall I would highly recommend this dash cam. It's a high quality cam. You should absolutely have one of these if you're a Uber/Lyft driver, no doubt. If you aren't, then it still gives you the most protection out of any cam I know of with the 3-channel video.

New to reddit and this group because I started driving Lyft a week ago.  Not bad, 600 in 6 days in the chicago area and that's only 3-4 hours a day.  However, I find all people in the suburbs want to go downtown or to the worst neighborhoods in Chicago.  I found myself driving in the way southside of Chicago at 1am where most of the murders happen.  Same on the West side on July 4th.  

I've found myself having to slide the wheel off during the rides so I can restart and judge what I want to do next, especially when I find myself in horrible areas.  It all makes me so sad.  I knew they existed in Chicago but it's right in your face, driving through it every night.  This fun description leads me to the Personal Power Zone stuff.  Rarely do I see a bonus light up when I continue to get rides in my queue.  But when I turn the app off and finish the current ride, I then see I'm in the middle of a pink powerzone and I get that extra 12 bucks or whatever the zone says.  That zone was 2 blocks from a murder of a 7 year old girl 3 hours before so it was a high risk pick up.  I've read up on the zone info and I'm just wondering if I'm being taken advantage of while ride and ride go into my queue and I don't see the power zones.  Their verbiage says riders in a hot zone will add a bonus to my ride but I just don't see it.  It also says that if I'm in a hot zone and a ride is assigned outside of it I'll get it, but I just want to make sure.  I don't see a way to verify the PPZ's while ride after ride go into my queue.  Is there anyway to verify if I was in a pink or purple zone while one goes into my queue or am I just to take Lyft's word for it when I don't see a bonus in a rough neighborhood?

I don't want to play the game of turning my wheel off and then seeing the zone I'm in but I want to make sure I'm being paid for the risks I'm taking.",Personal Power Zones

1593672818,Lyft,"I wasn’t sure if I was gonna write this,first off this is gonna be a long story but I’ll try not to make it too long as I’m trying to vent and also see if other Lyft drivers have ever experienced something similar,ok here it goes....So I was in San Diego on Friday night 6/19/2020,earlier that day I had passed the 70 ride mark for $450, I was so proud of myself cuz wow that was just a lot of driving and I’ve really only been doing Lyft for 3 weeks even tho I started in March and only did it for a few days back then,anyways I do one ride and decide I’m going to do 2 more so I can finish up my 3 rides in a row for $15 then go home as it was almost 11pm now and I had been driving almost 8 hours,I get a ping from a passenger while I drop off my first passenger/3, I head to the guy,it’s in a bar area,I’m right in front of the bar now but don’t see anyone who looks like they are waiting for a Lyft,I see two dudes laying on the floor and I go huh that’s funny,after waiting 30 seconds I turn my car off and call the guy,His name was Ronnell,I call him and see that the guy on the ground is answering the phone,I go uh oh. I get out my car and notice that there are two throw up puddles next to these two dudes,I tell them I’m sorry but I can’t take u,I don’t want throw up in my car,the one friend seemed to sober up real quick and was like naw man we good we good,Ronnell on the other hand could barely stand up,I tell them sorry I can’t take u and get in my car,I see that Ronnell is trying to open my door so I try to lock my doors but I was too late and he opened it,I tell him to please close my door and he says no,I say please close my door again and he says no,now I’m getting pissed so I get out my car and tell them to back the fuck up from my car,the soberish friend said that the Lyft is just for his friend because they’re not going to the same destination,Ronnell was mad that he would be charged $5 if I cancelled and I told him I would cancel and he wouldn’t be charged,he then said if he threw up that he would pay for the fee,I told him I didn’t care about $150 I just don’t want vomit in my car,the soberish friend is like begging me at this point to take his friend home,I’m just like ok how far does he live,they both don’t know,So I accept the ride to see the drop off address,it’s 5 miles and 10 minutes away,I tell Ronnell if I take you will u make sure to not throw up,he says yes,so I get him in the backseat,oh by the way he didn’t have a mask on,I didn’t even mention that,looking back I should’ve used that excuse as to not accept the ride but at the time I was just concerned about him puking,I get him in the backseat and tell him to not open his mouth because I had to put the seat belt around him like a little kid,he says why are you telling me to shut my mouth I ain’t no bitch,I’m like no dude it’s because u don’t have a mask and it’s for both our safety,ok now we’re off! I’m trying to drive as fast and safely as possible,right before we get on the freeway he starts threatening to beat my ass,Now first off I’m 6ft &amp; about 270 pounds so I was never scared of him cuz he was a little shorter than me and maybe 200 pounds but most importantly I could probably just push him and he would be out for the count,so anyways right before I get on the MLK freeway in SD he’s saying he’s gonna beat my ass when he gets out the car,I say naw man that ain’t gonna fly so I pull over and tell him to get out,he starts apologizing and saying sorry and that he just wants to get home,I thought about just throwing him out of my car but man if this dude were to get killed by an oncoming car after I accepted I feel like I might be held responsible,So I just continue to drive,now we’re 7 minutes away from this nightmare being over,I drove the whole time with only his window down,he was on the back right passenger seat,I shit u not I thought I had gone deaf because I kept hearing this weird sound and I’m guessing that was the sound of my ears popping cuz the wind was just coming from from that side of the window,it was so distracting and I tried my best not to roll up the window cuz I told him if he had to throw up then throw up outside the window (FYI I’m buying 2 throw up buckets for the future) So now we’re off the freeway and he starts saying that he’s sorry for being a dick,that’s he’s just drunk and that he hasn’t had sex in a year,I tell him it’s ok and that he just has to meet the right girl (or guy?). So we pull up to his house,it’s like a small gated community,I hurry up and open his door and say we’re here,He unbuckles his seat belt and starts to lean over my front seats,I didn't think about that too much as I had turned my phone flashlight on to see if he had thrown up,he gets out the car and asks why I'm recording him,I tell him I'm not that I'm just making sure he hadn't thrown up (He didn't thank God),He then says I haven't thrown up! I say ok great,I ask him if there's someone at his house because I didn't wanna just leave him outside the gate cuz I don't think he has the senses to get inside the gate,Then outta nowhere he says MAN FUCK YOU &amp; knocks my phone outta my hand.....for like a second I couldn't believe it,I go to pick up my phone,Now my phone is old,it's an iPhone 6S that I bought in 2016 and it was already cracked,screen was cracked and it's pretty rough but it works,now when I picked it up the front glass is like bulging out,like sticking out,I tell him 'Ronnell you just broke my fu*king phone',he just laughs and starts walking to the gate.....it's at this moment that I start thinking of beating his ass,I'm so mad and irritated at this point I can't put it into words....he puts his hand over the gate to open it from the other side and closes it as I walk towards him. He closes it fast and I see he lives in the second house closest to me. I tell him I'm calling the cops and he says he doesn't care. So I called 911 and I tell them that I'm not currently in danger but that I'm a Lyft driver and that a passenger knocked my phone outta my hand and damaged my property (Oh by the way,my phone was still functioning,Although in worse condition than it was before I picked him up) they said since it wasn't an emergency that I would have to wait for a patrol unit to come and that since San Diego is a big city that she couldn't tell me how long that would be,so I told her I would wait and I wait...for 30 minutes,she even asked what I wanted the cops to do,I wanted to file a police report &amp; hold this asshole accountable but after 30 minutes I knew they wouldn't really care or do anything about it,they would probably just laugh,in between the 911 call and when I left I had contacted Lyft via chat and told them everything,they said they couldn't give me the $150 I asked for for the phone because they said they only reimburse for damages to the car,they also told me they couldn't help me out with the $15 streak I was on (He was my 2nd ride and I had to cancel the 3rd ride because I called the cops). So they just said that they wouldn't pair me with him again but this is after I left him a 1 Star review warning other drivers not to accept him! So anyways I drive the 35 miles back to my house at 12:30am,Driving 80MPH pretty pissed off and just thinking about that night....When I got home I noticed that the $10 he gave me is missing! Remember when I said he was leaning towards the front seats? Yea he took his tip back,idk man I didn't even think to put it in the glove box or anything I just figured I would get to it later,I was just trying to get this guy out my car,I also found my Darth Vader debit card in the back seat,I was like how tf did he get my debit card? Come to find out it was his debit card,I guess we both like Star Wars go figure,I thought about using his card to fill up my tank but knew doing that would pretty much get me kicked off of Lyft and in trouble with the cops so I took the high road and didn't.

1591804227,Lyft,"Be at the address on the app. It doesn't help if you come out and wait at the gate for any reason. Go back. It doesn't matter if you tell the whole army. We will find a way to get to the pin unless totally blocked by a metal gate.

Try to avoid needing any communications. Some drversi don't read. Some don't talk. I'll leave it at that. Basically, don't try to talk me away from the pin. That's where the money is.

A street number is the least helpful. But for residential addresses, we have the hold street for reference. If your residence don't have a number displayed, sit at the front and carry a big sign helps.

For anything other things, the best are some hospitals with the big name and street number right on top of the entrance. Beat that. If we need to turn in from the main road, the entry paths for different businesses are side to side or some 20 ft apart, which is less than the resolution of typical GPS at the best conditions.

If you have the app, enter the name of the entity first or slip in some identifying names inside the address.

First, I don't take my eyes off the road. 2nd I might glance for people at the sidewalk it they are obvious. I need to glance at the phone only when I need to. So I'm not going to look at the phone and look for the street number where you are. Typically, the destination address don't appear on the phone until the last few seconds.

Thanks but oh please! Don't you get the hint? I still have the tip box that I never put in the car. There's no sign in the car about stars and anything else.

I got all sorts of compliments all the time. I'm a pretty good driver when I'm not speeding. Nobody faults my navigation except for the clueless who never use GPS before. I have a duster with a ten-foot pole so the seats will look clean in a second. I have a stick vacuum in the trunk. If you leave anything behind, one passes by the roller, and the OEM mat looks new. For the rest, there's the pointed nozzle. I also have a 3 ft long prong to pick up anything nasty. I have a hook to open the car doors without touching the handles so I can check the back as often as I want. I ozone the car every day so it can't possibly smell.

Lyft forces many of us to be heroes from time to time, driving 15 miles to pick a trip for 3 minutes. If I got an above-and-beyond, it must be my practically air-tight partition.

I don't mind any music you want to put on. I have Spotify subscription and I don't mind whatever volume you prefer. I have layered outfits for all-weather so I also don't mind whatever climate control you prefer. Just ask. I also got compliments as a friendly driver. The problem is, it's hard work to second guess all the riders. And I don't.

I never worked for tips so excuse me for not good at it and I have no intention to learn for the long-haul. The driving bit is pretty easy and I got enough extra cash to keep me afloat and working my way out, which doesn't matter too much if it works out or not, sooner or later, because, well, the driving bit is easy.

1589920084,Lyft,"If you can't afford the fare, stay at home. Lyft may be happy to refund you but your account will be flagged if you do it more than once. It's not simple to keep creating new accounts unless you rarely ride.

The lowest life is the fake accident reporters. Lyft has to deactivate the driver immediately. Drivers may lose working hours or days because of a few dollars of your pocket money. But it's also rather silly. Once the driver submits 4 corner pictures of the car without a scratch, the case is closed and you are a proven liar.

If you are not careful, your Lyft report may become an insurance claim and you be entered into the industry fraud database affecting your future ability to get any insurance.

It's not just me. When I turn on the app at home, I often get something like a request from the 3rd Target closest to my house, almost all of them are teen essential workers wanting to go home.

A teen even reported me for a hit-and-run! Now if Lyft sent me over to be criminally investigated you have to be investigated as a witness too. Or if you are so righteous as to report me when you heard a sound in the dark that I might damage some people's property, you should ask to get out and investigate. If I don't let you out its kidnapping. If you only do it for a few dollars of refund, you are not going to help the property owners.

No, I'm not going to ask everybody your music preference and the climate control preference. If anybody cares about that, Lyft would have deactivated me long ago, or they will just ask. I'm a human being; I'm not going to sound like a broken record every 10 minutes. I have Spotify subscription for you. And I can put on my fleece jacket or take off my shirt for you.

Live in a small town where we only have a handful of lyfts running and thankfully I’m friends with one of them(also close friend of my wife’s family which comes into play later)

This evening my friend that does Lyft called my mother-in-law to let her know that someone placed an request to have my grandfather-in-law(87 years old had his name/home address and everything) picked up and taken to from east Texas to Alabama. 

The people who placed the request then called the Lyft driver and told him that they wanted the driver to let them know when he had grand father and  that they would meet him to pick him up. The driver then called the people who made the request and lied saying he had her grandfather and they asked for proof and wanted him out on the phone. 

This haven’t escalated anything past this but my wife’s family are reasonably shaken up.

-Always check your vehicle for any Damaga after the passenger gets out. 
-Send a receipt within 24 hours, even if you buy some towels or something. 
-Please just please, if you are going to send a receipt, for God's sake, at least edit the template receipt you downloaded from the internet, and fill it with some real information, and print it! 
-Take the photos with your camera, so they are saved in your gallery...

Hi Tan,

Thanks for reaching out, my name is Arlex from Lyft support and I'll be glad to help you with this no show fee.

Upon reviewing this ride, I can see that the arrive button wasn't tapped at the rider's pickup point, which is why the no-show fee was not charged. I know there are circumstances that make reaching a rider's pickup location difficult, and I know you tried your best in order to get to the rider's location, but tapping to arrive at the requested location is a requirement to receive the cancellation fee.

Since the arrival was marked somewhere else, we are unable to charge the passenger nor grant you a no show fee according to our policy. 

To learn more about our cancel or no show fee policy, you can take a look at our Help Center article.

Remember that for any further questions, we’re here 24/7 to assist you. Have a nice day.

1587996809,Lyft,Anyone filter not work last night?? I set my filter to only recieve rides heading home but was still getting requests from 18 minutes away.

I was getting a request from nurses and warehouses workers which obviously are essential and need to get to their jobs. I was willing to go out as usual on Sunday night but it was very discouraging knowing that there were less drivers out at that time but request are still coming. Passengers are suffering and frustrated after waiting over 30 minutes due to the changing of drivers.

1587522708,Lyft,"First time using Lyft tonight and I had a horrible experience. I requested a ride and while I was waiting for “Juan” to show up, I saw on the map that he was outside my house and I had 5 minutes to get out to him. I was already waiting on my porch, and even though the GPS indicated he was here, he was nowhere to be seen. I walked around to the back of my house just in case he came in the back way, and he wasnt there either. Then I noticed on the map, he was back on the interstate going in the opposite direction of the ride I requested. I tried calling him through the app, and it would not allow me to do so, stating my driver was currently in route and unable to accept phone calls. Meanwhile, it is indicating that I was the person in route with him! I continued to try reaching him by messages and calls, unsuccessfully, because I was trying to get to the pharmacy before it closed to pick up some badly needed antibiotics for a spider bite infection. Since he never showed, I needed another ride, but Lyft would not allow me to schedule another one because It looked to them that I was with Juan. I watched him on the map to see where he was going and he was in the next town over and finally ended the ride 2 hours later in a town 80 some miles away. When I check my ride history, it is showing that what I had originally scheduled as an $8.00 ride, is now over $100. What the hell? How am I responsible for this? Ive contacted Lyft regarding this charge and I am waiting to hear back, but wow!! To say I am unimpressed with Lyft is a complete understatement. Not only am I being charged a bunch for a ride I didnt take, I was incredibly inconvenienced by not being able to schedule another ride to get my meds. And trust me, I needed to start that shit like yesterday! Lol

Has anyone else had anything similar happen? How likely am I to not be charged for this ride?

1587489306,Lyft,"My father is 78 but quite healthy for his age. He is retired but has been driving Lyft for the last 2 years to pay down debt. He absolutely loves the job. He lives at home with me, and my girlfriend is staying here too during COVID, after she was furloughed from her job.

With COVID and the Michigan stay-at-home order, I convinced my dad (with difiiculty) not to drive for Lyft, at least until May 1. It was a difficult discussion because he doesn't agree with the risks of COVID-19, and he didn't seem to understand that my girlfriend is immuno-compromised and at a higher risk. I worked with him on his finances and determined that if he paid minimum payments on his debt, for a couple months (hopefully) while he didn't drive for Lyft, he would be fine.

Now he's asking again to drive for Lyft. He says he needs money and seems to forget that we figured out the finances before. He says he'll wear a mask and gloves while driving all day. Trouble is, I'm not sure he will remember to do that all day, every day.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I received a pickup request at the big hospital on tusc and clarendon. I don't have a date on this, but I know it was summer of either 2018 or 2019. The request sent me to a specific entrance, and rider never showed. I called twice, waited extra. no show, so I ""no showed"" the ride. When I was driving off, someone working at the hospital flagged me down and said he was the rider. I asked why he did not answer when I attempted to call, why he was at the wrong entrance? He said his phone died, and did not put in the wrong entrance. He was able to verify ride details. He didn't look like the type to rob me for my chump change.  I had not done my good deed for the month, so I took him to his destination.I knew right off bat there was a 50/50 chance of getting paid by lyft for this ride. I contacted lyft and told them that i completed the ride after the no show. Lyft did not pay me for the ride, due to there being no record in the system. I wasn't even surprised, as I knew there was a good chance I would not be paid in full for the ride when I agreed to take him to his destination. Ok, I'd prefer the rider and lyft get that together, but whatever. Didn't even try and only cared a little.
2. 08/11/2019 : I received a pickup request at the pizza place on whipple across from savalot and the bowling alley. I went and picked up the rider. There were two women, one got in. The other came to my window asking me questions about myself, clearly drunk, trying to screen me. I was nice, told her minimal personal data and reassured her everything was ok. She continued to investigate, I don't recall exactly what question she asked which I dismissed, but her alcohol breath in my face was what I DO remember. She wasn't the rider, and initially I got the impression the rider was trying to get away from her. I pulled out and verified the destination with the rider. The rider said she was NOT headed to her destination, that she just wanted to go around the block. Whatever. Rider navigated a few blocks, around, back to the pizza place - and I dropped her off. I clicked the dropoff button as I had done over 1,300something times (I got the lyft jacket finally sent to me AFTER I stopped driving) -- and there was no drive fare added to my balance. After I clicked dropoff -- Lyft app screen froze for a moment and went back to the regular screen.

I contacted lyft help asking why I was not credited for this ride. To which Lyft help responded they showed I accidentally hit the cancel button INSTEAD OF THE PICKUP BUTTON at the start of the ride. I responded that I did not click the cancel button anywhere at any time. I told them the passenger wanted to go around the block and dropped off. I dropped off the passenger and clicked the dropoff button and got no fare. Lyft responded again - that they understand accidents happen, that I just probably clicked the cancel button and didn't know it. When I told them I was finishing up my lyft contract due to this (If they can skip me on a 3.00 fare, whats to stop them from blaming a $100 fare loss on an accident or a glitch?) - Lyft responded once again that since their systems show a cancel button pressed they were gonna consider it cancelled - and there was no payment from the rider, and thus no way to pay me.

&amp;#x200B;

So. The first ride COULD have been credited, but I knew there was a risk some stingy bastard would not break me off crumbs from that lyft corporate account. I accepted that. The second ride made it clear I was being nudged into pegging territory. If lyft will refuse to pay me for a 3.00 fare based on nothing, whats to stop them from refusing to pay me a $100 fare based on nothing? So I stopped driving for lyft. 

Uber was a worse experience. I drove for lyft about 2.5 years. I drove for uber about 6 months. Uber kept sending me their worst riders. Daily I was being sent to domestic violence shelters, rehab hospitals, a few times a week at the jail, or just mostly somebody delivering weed when I got Uber pickups. Lyft wasn't that bad, but a straight up breach of contract is a breach of contract, unacceptable at a smaller degree or especially at a larger degree. Most problems start small, and grow if not resolved. I picked up that red flag real quick.

I hope they fix this, but not for me as I have now moved on to more a more secure income source that doesn't add wear and tear to my vehicle.

when he picked me up he had two phones up front and i could see he was also doing uber while driving. he has a passenger he was supposed to be picking up on uber at the same time as me. because his phone was in the gps holder thing if u know what i mean i could see him get and open a text and it was what i presume was the rider telling him where to go

yesterday i got him again as a driver and he sat in place for ten minutes. i texted him and asked if he could cancel it if he wasnt going to come so i could get a new driver and nothing so i just cancelled it and disputed the cancel charge, took an uber instead

Earlier last month I rented from Hertz using Lyfts Express Drive or whatever that program was called and they screwed up the actual plate on the vehicle as to the plate within the driver app, they didn't match. They told me to return the vehicle so I did that and told them I don't want to continue. A couple days ago I received this in the mail. Incase some of you can't read it clearly, I'll type it below verbatim. It states:

""This is to inform you that your rental and authorized operator privileges, as well as any membership in service programs (Gold, #1 Club, etc.) have been permanently suspended at Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty, and Firefly Car Rental because a rental vehicle was used by you or with your permission for any illegal purpose, including the commission of a felony or misdemeanor.

If you disagree with the above information, we are willing to further review the circumstances regarding the suspension upon receipt of a written request for reinstatement along with any supporting documentation.

From time to time, you may receive promotional material.  This material should be disregarded, since it has been sent inadvertently, and does not affect this decision in any way.

1585350607,Lyft,"Some pax are impossible. Two guys went back to their motel. They ate some biscuits on a short trip and made a mess. OEM floormats all moved a few ft. A lady at the vulnerable age got a whole cart of goods during Target closing, but luckily she brought a big screen TV too big for my car.

My recommendation is to bring your own sanitizer or wipes or whatever if you need to. Open the windows if you have to. Wash your hands and clothes after the ride if possible. Or wear a lab overcoat or painters' protective clothes and change out of it after the ride.

All supplies are out or expensive. We can't do any better than you do.

It's not possible to disinfect after every ride. If you read the labels, you need to wet the seat for 10 minutes and let it air dry. We can't even break even to pay for the supplies. You should also look up what ""hazardous to humans and pets"" means. Anything else is cosmetics.

It's also not a good idea to get close to the seats and touch them after every rider. What if the last rider is infected? What if I'm infected? How about you? Even latex gloves are being price gouged. 

All I have is some alcohol swabs. Yes, they are tiny (even for the largest size) but that's all I have. You should have at least put the packaging into the bin, not on the floor.","Dear riders, you cannot rely on drivers to sanitize before and after you"

1584502348,Lyft,,Taxicab Confessions (Fiction Story)
1584500496,Lyft,"Not much happening in St Louis on Tuesday nights, especially when it’s cold. St Louis is a major city, but not as big as Chicago or NYC. Downtown is usually pretty empty after 9pm on week nights. It’s a good time for night-shift cabbies to just sit in a cab and reflect on things or to get high. I know some guys were on crack and others were on some other shit. Many smoked weed and I was one of those many. Driving a cab was so depressing that I started smoking weed regularly. I drove high all the time. Some passenger even told me once, “Hey, it smells like weed in here,” and I said, “Yeah, someone right before you was smoking weed in here.” But this time, I was parked next to Crown Plaza hotel--there is a taxi stand there--and hoping that some visitors were bored out of their minds in their hotel rooms and wanted to go hit some strip clubs across the river. Take’em there, bring’em back later--about $40--a dream for a Tuesday. I needed to make about $150, though, and there was no one in sight. There weren’t any conventions in town that week either and so there weren’t that many visitors downtown at all. I had to do something. And I did. I got my pipe out and got high.

I got high and started thinking about life, about my life, and how I used to be a Staff Sergeant in the US Air Force and was a good and honest citizen, but gambled my career to pursue a small business dream. Here I was, spending 16 hours per day in a cab, high most of the time, being a fuck-up, sinking. At home everything was fucked up too. The Christmas before that I left the house to go to work--I went to drive around no one. I just didn’t want to be there with my wife and my mother-in-law.  I couldn’t believe how everything just went south after I left the military. But then, some guy came out of the residential building that was next to the Crown Plaza and raised his hand. And as soon as he did that, another taxi from a stand a whole block behind me, which was next to the Hyatt hotel, turned on his lights and started honking. He was hoping that I was asleep. But, I put my foot on the brake, put the car in drive and moved forward.

I unlocked the doors and he quickly jumped in my cab. “Hello, where to, sir?” I asked. “Do you know if the gas station down the street is open around this time of the night?” I lowered my eyes to the dash board and noticed it was 1:35am. That gas station was already closed. “I think it’s open. You wanna go there?” “Yes, let’s head over that way.” “Sure, not a problem, sir” I replied, and then started the meter and took off. I presumed he needed some cigarettes.  Yeah, $20 a pack. I smiled and remembered how I took some first timers in St Louis to an Italian restaurant located in The Hill area of St Louis, which was recommended to them by the hotel staff. I took’em there via the highway loop and turned a $15 trip into a $75 trip. And when they asked me why it was so far, I told them that’s why it’s called The Hill, it’s The Hill of St Louis.

“How’s your night? Busy?” Slick was trying to be nice so that I wouldn’t screw him over. “Kinda,” I said. “Anything happening tonight?” “Not that I know of.” “How long you’ve been driving a cab?” “About a year and a half.” “You like it?” And when he asked me that question, I remember how I picked up this one dude who literally got thrown out of another cab for pissing off the cabbie. I guess he asked him the same question. “It’s my business. I own this cab. It was the only thing I found I could do in this economy,” I said. “Yes, times are tough, I know.” 

While we were going there, I made sure to drive the downtown speed limit and tried to hit all the stop lights, or as many stop lights as I could. I only did that with the passengers. I usually did the stop-n-go at the lights downtown and around town without passengers. I only stopped when there was a sign which stated that there is a fine for running the red light and was photo enforced. All other cameras didn’t bother me. I even drove 45mi/h in a 25mi/h zone right in front of the police. They were too busy with some real St Louis problems and did not have the time to deal with speeding cabbies. You weren’t the real cabbie if you weren’t running the stop lights. 

We came to the gas station and it was closed. Meter was showing a little over $5. “Fuck! Let’s go to the one on Chouteau.” We kept going.

We got to Chouteau and 14th street and there was now over $7 on the meter. It too was closed. “Do you know if there’s another gas station nearby?” he asked. Of course I knew. It was my business to know. I knew there was another closed gas station up the street. “Yeah, there is one right up the street here.” “Let’s go there,” he said. “Yes, sir.”

We get there, meter’s $9, the gas station’s closed. “What the fuck, man? I hate this fucking city. Nothing’s fucking open.”  He started getting frustrated. I didn’t blame him. This city sucks, especially when you don’t know shit about it and when your cab driver is milking you.

“Is there a gas station that’s close by and open right now?” he asked. I knew there was one open a bit south from where we were, but I thought I should take him to the one across downtown at Jefferson and MLK. It was farther and I would make more money. So I said, “How about the Mobil on Jefferson?”  “Yes, go there! That one’s always open,” he replied and I proceeded over there.

We get to the Mobil. Meter’s $12. “I’ll be right back.” He went inside, went up to the clerk, asked him something, the clerk shook his head, and he turned around and came back. “Is there another gas station?” Hm, I guessed it wasn’t the cigarettes he was looking for. Meter kept adding more money for the waiting time. I took some time to think while acting like I am thinking of a gas station. We were at the north-western boundary of downtown and I knew that there was another gas station in downtown that was open. But, this meant that I would take him close to home. That was a bad idea. Then I thought of a gas station that was further west on Grand. “Dude, how can you work without a GPS? Why don’t you have a GPS in your cab? Those things store all that information and it’s real easy and quick to find.” I smiled and told him that I had one until someone robbed me at gun point and took my GPS with him. “Oh, sorry to hear that, man. That’s fucked up.” “Yeah!” I added. I lied, though. My GPS was in the glove box. “There’s a gas station on Grand. How about that one?” “You mean the one by Del Taco over there?” “Yes, sir.” “Yes, go there. And do you have any tunes in this motherfucker? What do you listen to?” “No, sir, the radio doesn’t work.” “But I see you have an aftermarket radio installed in your cab.” “Yes, I do, but I have a scanner connected to it so that I can hear taxi orders that get dispatched over the air through my car’s speakers.”  I was using a scanner in my cab, which was prohibited by the taxi commission, to listen to the radio waves of other cab companies and stole their orders occasionally. I had to disguise the system from the taxicab commission’s regular inspections. The radio wasn’t working. But, I could connect my iPhone to the iPhone connector that was hidden below the seat, and we could listen to some music, like Pandora radio, but I didn’t want to hear any music at the time.

We get to the Circle K on Grand. Meter--$18. He goes inside then comes back, and by the look on his face I could tell they didn’t have what he was looking for. I started thinking of another gas station I could take him to. There was Gas House that was very close by but was closed and was further west.  However, there was also a BP there, which was open. So, I suggested we go to the Phillips 66 on Lindell. He agreed and I took the way that did not have any gas stations on it until we got to Phillips 66. Meter now had $20 on it. He’s in and out. They don’t have it either.

By this time, some of my high was beginning to wear off. I started thinking about a hit. But of course I had to wait until I’m done with this dude. I was also beginning to wonder what it is that he’s looking for. And so I asked him, “If you don’t mind me asking, sir, what is it that you’re looking for?” “I’m looking for the love rose,” he replied, and then after seeing my confused face continued, “Listen, man, I am an engineer, I’m a good guy, I work for a big oil company, I make a lot of money, but I’m a fuck-up. I have some crack that I’m trying to smoke and don’t have a pipe. They sell these pipes at some of these gas stations and they call them the ‘love rose.’ Is there another gas station here?”

So, when he said pipe and crack, I knew that I needed to stay away from the north or south side gas stations and needed to keep going west. This is the kind of shit they won’t sell on the west side in gas stations. West side of St Louis is where the rich and the professionals live. The closest gas station to where we were and which that was open was at Kingshighway and Delmar. It’s on the south boundary of the north side ghetto. We don’t want to go there. “Man, terrible luck you’re having tonight,” I said. The gas station further west from where we were was either at Hwy 40 and Hampton, or at the Skinker exit. But, I needed to get him to agree to go there as it wasn’t a close distance. 

“There is another gas station that’s open right now and it’s at Hwy 40 and Hampton. Would you like to go there?” I suggested.  Although, by now, I too wanted him to find his fucking pipe already. I too wanted to get high and this dude was bothering me now. “Yes, let’s go there, but be quick please. I have to find it quickly. This girl is waiting for me at her place on the east side,” was his reply. Cool, I thought, that’s like at least another $30.

So, we get to the Mobil on Hampton. $28 on the meter. I’m rooting for him now. Few minutes later he comes out smiling.  “Alright, I got it. Let’s go to Belleville now.” “Do you know where in Belleville we’re going, sir?” I asked. “I’ll call her when we’ll get close and she’ll tell us how to get there.” “OK,” I said, and proceeded to the highway. Belleville, I thought, that’s another 25 miles. That’s like $50.

“Dude, I’m going over there to smoke with this chick and then I’m going to bang her. I’ll be there for an hour or so. Can you wait for me and then bring me back home?” “Sure, it’s $20 per hour for the waiting time.” Kewl, I thought to myself. That’s like another $60. But deep down inside, I couldn’t wait to get this fucker out of my cab. He kept asking me to tell him a story. And I just wanted it to be quite so that I could reflect on things.

After a while, we got to Belleville, and his girl guided us to her place over the phone. By the time we got to her place, there was $81 on the meter. It’s almost 3am. He left and assured me that he’s coming back in an hour or maybe less. I wasn’t worried about this guy not coming back. He wasn’t one of those that screw you over.

And so as soon as he left, I pulled out my pipe, loaded some weed in it and began to smoke it outside of my cab. I kept thinking about how and why I got to this point in my life. How is it that I or he can one day be examples of pride and success, and the next day become fuckups. 

He came back an hour later. He got in my cab and went to sleep. When we got back to his house, there was now $145 on the meter. I let him sleep in the cab for another $15 until he woke up.

“We’re here, sir.” “How much I owe you?” ”One sixty, sir.”

He gave me his credit card and asked me to figure out what 20% is and add it as a tip. “There is a 5% fee for credit card transactions, sir.” “Fine, add that too.” I charged this fee whenever I could, this was a perfect time for it.

I added the numbers and ran the credit card through my wireless credit card processor. It was approved. He signed the receipt. He wasn’t happy to see the $201-bill, but he signed it.

“Thank you, sir, see you later.” He didn’t say anything and left.",Taxicab Confessions (Fiction Story)

If you don't get the guaranteed amount after completing the rides, Lyft will issue a bonus to cover the difference between the guaranteed and the actual earnings.

1579616998,Lyft,"This is two parts I’ll sum up pretty quickly . 

So I’ve been driving for Lyft for a year and a half I’ve done over 2000 rides and have driven in two different major cities . After that many people in my car I think I can make a fair judge of the worst passengers and by far it is white people . Any ethnicity other than white is usually a blast I’m a naturally social person and if you can tell by the tag I’m fairly young . I bring a lot energy into anything I do . I’m a easy going person so I try to have my pax feel the same . I can get that same fun energy out of any race other than white people ive had in depth conversations with people who hardly speak English . But a white pax(white Americans not Europeans they are always fun)  will get in my car and awkwardly stare out the window and sometimes not even acknowledge me which is rude asf and I do not tolerate . I have put people out for not addressing me . Your getting in my car I pay for . Lyft is just supplementary idc about being someone’s personal *b*tch* I have a full time job and I’m also in school part time but the days I do it I drive non stop . But anyways if they engage it’s usually very poorly . They sit awkwardly and look uncomfortable as hell when I play my own music (I do not listen to pop or the radio ) if they ask I’ll always change but it’s like the only time they want to be heard is when they complain . Which brings me to my next point . Btw I’ve encountered some cool ass white pax but majority on. This scale . 

Going through these threads I’ve noticed how timid and scary some of these drivers come off , it’s pretty sad . Your not an indentured serving to Lyft . I read threads on reddit that people say they literally try not to talk to pax too much ???! Like for what ? Or the fact stopping for gas isn’t proper etiquette. Listen I am 5 star rated I’ve stopped for gas . Eaten with pax (when they offer only not eating and driving) , I’ve been offered numerous times to hang out with pax , because I’m m self .

I suspect but don’t know for sure it was this guys house in particular I got a nail in my tire, but I had a gut feeling something bad was going to happen. Well, At least he tipped.

1579549969,Lyft,"Serious question here … apologies if it's a bit long.

I'm general manager for a small home-located business.  Our employees drive company pickup trucks on their routes during the day and are allowed to drive the trucks home as opposed to having to drive to our property and switch out vehicles day after day.

We have an employee that we are going to need to terminate soon due to a pattern of dishonesty and poor performance after numerous ""second chances.""  When the day comes we're going to have to call him here to the office, inform him he's fired and explain why, and then he's going to need to remove whatever personal items he might have in the truck and leave the premises.  However, his home is at least a 20-minute drive away from here and I don't know that anyone would be readily available to give him a ride.  This is a mid-sized town and we're just outside the city limits, so it's not like there's a public place within walking distance he could go to wait.  There's also no public transportation to speak of.

He's married but his wife works and wouldn't necessarily be available.  He might have a friend or another family member that could give him a lift but there's no guarantee.  Either I or the company owner could drive him to his house and drop him off but that's awkward for us, undignified for him, etc.  This guy isn't really into technology and I doubt he's got Uber or Lyft or any other ride-share apps on his phone, although those are readily available here.  I've got the apps and I use them occasionally.  Would it be fine to just call a Lyft on my app and arrange for his ride home?  He's not a violent or threatening person, he's a small middle-aged guy.  Any personal items he was taking out of the truck could probably fit in a modest-sized box.

1578952209,Lyft,"I had an early morning flight and needed to leave my house ideally at 4am. Knowing that it might be tough to catch a Lyft that early, I opened my app at 3:30 and requested a normal ride (not pool). There weren’t many drivers on the road, and the one that picked up my ride was still on another ride. The guy was listed as 18 minutes away. It seemed like that was cutting it close but I kept an eye on his location and saw when he finished his previous ride. Then, for about 3 minutes, it didn’t look like he was moving so I called to see if there was an updated ETA. He said, “oh, I’m sorry, I’m already on another ride.” I asked if that meant he wasn’t coming to get me, and he confirmed that he was going elsewhere. I responded, “what?? No, you can’t do that to me!” And he said that it wasn’t his fault, the app added another ride that jumped ahead of mine. Is that even possible? At that point, I didn’t have time to cancel and wait for a new ride, so I just left it as my current ride. 

What I ended up doing was waking up my roommate at 4 am and having him take me, and the guy never canceled my ride on his end. I texted him a couple of times, asking him to cancel my ride, but all I got was the automated response text. I could see that he was still moving around the city, and it stayed as the “current ride” on my account until 14 hours later, when I contacted Lyft and asked them to cancel it on my behalf. Is it possible for drivers to take other rides ahead of mine without canceling it? Was there a glitch allowing the ride to stay as my ride on my end, but not as one in queue for him? 

When I contacted Lyft, they gave a general “sorry for the inconvenience” response with a voucher and making it so that I can’t be matched with him again, but they didn’t answer whether or not rides are always in chronological order, or if rides can just be bumped ahead of another.

1578904086,Lyft,"Here you go after getting home I decided to type everything out while it was still fresh in my mind for when we go to court. Here it is:

At approximately 1945 I accepted an uber ride from Slicks bar on capital ave. I arrived at about 1950, at roughly 1955 a man and woman walked from about 2 blocks down west liberty Avenue to my car. The man visibly intoxicated started to signal me to wind down my window and pound on it he was visibly angry that he had to walk 2 blocks because he put the wrong address in. I motioned for him to open the door because my driver side controls sometimes dont work and this was one of those times. When he does open the door he says ""are you the fucking uber or what?"" I respond ""yes I'm sorry sometimes that window doesnt work"" the female then enters the back seat, as the male enters he says ""oh yeah I'm sure the fucking windows doesnt work uh hu, fucking piece of shit"" I then try to descalate the conversation saying ""yeah sometimes it doesnt but I can still take you guys"" he then starts belligerently yelling and cursing at me at which point I say ""hey man if it's going to be an issue we can cancel the ride right now and you can get another ride home"". The female then starts to beg me to take them home as he continues to scream and cuss at me. I then tell them ""never mind you have been disrespectful and extremely hostile I will cancel the ride and you can just pay the cancel fee."" This infuriates him. They argue with me for a moment until they finally get out. As he shuts the door he says ""fuck you you bearded faggot"" and proceeds to spit in my face. So at this point I dial the police because I'm sick of drunk riders doing this kind of stuff and thinking there is no consequences. As they walk away and I'm on the phone with the dispatcher I step out of the car and say ""hey bud what's your last name so I can tell the dispatcher who just assaulted me"",(*! This was my big mistake, I should have never done this I should have driven down the road and stayed on with police! Learn from my mistake and never get out!!!!*) he walks up the sidewalk a little further and starts yelling again, then runs around the car to my drivers door and opens it then looks me in the eye and says "" big mistake leaving the door unlocked man"" and proceeds to enter the divers seat and reach for the ignition. I now pull my licensed concealed carry pistol and aim it at him as I order him out of the car. He gets out a few moments later, he then starts taunting me to shoot him and trash talking me while moving towards me. At this point hes staying between me and the drivers door so I stay about 15 feet away. Once he moves from in between me and the drivers door I take my chance to get into the vehicle start it up and drive a little down the road until police are able to arrive. At this point I have put my gun inside the car and I flag an officer down and immediately surrender with my hands up telling them that I was the one with the gun and the guy tried to steal my car. I was handcuffed detained, questioned, and when the dust settled and the video was reviewed I was released and he went off to jail. I now sit banned from the uber software.",Uber banned me for stopping a pax from stealing my car.

I use Lyft extensively to get to school, since I am far away from any train.  In the past 3-4 months (Sept-Dec), I have spent more than $1,000 in using Lyft.  I haven't received any promotion/credit, other than me telling Lyft about a safety issue, in which they reimbursed me and gave a $5 credit.  

I was curious about this and asked Lyft support if this is typical in receiving no offers/promotions. They said this was peculiar considering my usage and gave me a $5 credit as a way to make it up to me.

How often do you all receive promotions/discounts/coupons from Lyft, due to your usage?  It'd be great to hear some different perspectives.  I'm hoping this wasn't an issue on the back-end with my account and I could've saved some money.

1576452982,Lyft,"Background: My friend and I left the bar around 1:20 AM to get to our destination that was 6 miles away. My friend had pizza with him and a small container of ranch. My friend lives down the street from my place and was banking on the driver taking him to his place for some cash once I was dropped off. 

Incident: When the driver arrived at my destination I got out of the car and he ended the fare. At this time my friend remained in the car and asked the driver to drop him off at his place down the street for a few dollars. He declared he wished he had asked prior to him ending the fare because he had already accepted a new ride. My friend finally convinced the driver to drop him off. I stayed next to the vehicle with the passenger door open to confirm that the driver was okay with this. He ensured me it was no problem. At this time, there was no damage claim. 

Once my friend got to his destination, I received a damage charge of $50 because the container of ranch spilled in the back seat. The driver accused me of the damages however, he did not mention it at the conclusion of my personal fare. He took cash to take my friend to his place down the road.

Per Lyft Help page, instructs me “the easiest way to recover a lost item is to contact the driver directly”.

I attempt to contact the driver directly. All this does is open a support ticket instructing Lyft to contact the driver on my behalf.

Lyft contacts me requesting my contact info. I provide. Lyft states the driver will contact me directly.

Lyft then contacts me stating the driver could not find my lost item.

So 1) I cannot contact the driver directly, contrary to what Lyft’s Help Page states. And 2) I cannot receive a callback from driver contrary to what Lyft support stated.

After a lot of back and fourth, I was told by Lyft support to open a police report for lost/stolen item. The police agency can then subpoena Lyft for driver information to investigate case.

1573699955,Lyft,"Hi there. 
About two months ago, I started using Lyft nearly daily to go to and from work. I had a few questions that I wasn’t finding good answers for on google so I came here. 

I just started really wondering about some things  because I had two really awkward experiences today. And normally I really have no issues or complaints. The driver who picked me up this am was a really sweet girl around my same age and we chatted a bit, so no complaints there, but she would not take the proper route (that EVERY other driver takes) to get me to work. I got a little irritated because she went a super weird way, had to make two u-turns, cause she turned at the wrong place, took the wrong exit, and then tried to drop me off at the wrong location. I remained polite and didn’t really say anything besides telling her how to get to the right building. My original drop off time was 11:21 and she didn’t get me there until 11:46. Which caused me to be hella late to work and get in trouble with my boss. So that’s the first time I’ve ever only given 4 stars and I tipped 15%. And then on the way home today, my driver was a nice dude who made great conversation but kept asking me out. (3 times to be exact) he was friendly but made me a tad uncomfortable with how pushy he was about us hanging out. Once I told him that I’m married (which I am) he politely dropped it but still.. I went ahead and still tipped him 25% and rated 5 stars though still because he was friendly and quick. But those two incidences today made me wonder how me rejecting the guys advances, and me giving a 4 star rating to the girl could affect my passenger rating. I’ve never received the email that I’ve heard people supposedly get when they receive a 5 star passenger rating which really makes no sense cause I always leave a five star rating, plus at least a 20% tip. I always exchange niceties with my driver, and never eat in the car, or make a mess etc. and I always try to be quick when they arrive so they never wait more than a minute or two.. working in customer service myself I always try to be polite when I’m a customer to someone else. I’ve also wondered if I have a bad rating or something because I started to notice that recently over the last few weeks it’s taking drivers a bit longer to get to me even though there’s always a dozen or so cars showing near me on the map.. which is frustrating due to it making it hard to know when I need to call one, in order to be on time to work everyday. Is there any possible explanations for that? I’ll also often get a notification saying that they found a new driver that’s closer, but it will take them just as long. It’s becoming more and more common that a driver that’s 2 min away when I order it takes 10 minutes to get there. 

The TL;DR version of these questions are: 
-How do I know if I have a bad passenger rating?
- is it okay to politely tell a driver that they are making you late due to them taking a much longer route unnecessarily
-how do I handle being hit on by drivers 
- is there a reason drivers are taking longer recently to pick me up even though there’s always a lot of them near me",Lyft passenger here with a few questions

1573665601,Lyft,"Hello! I'm asking this for a friend.

He tried out ExpressDrive but didn't really like it, and it turns out he was able to get a used car elsewhere.

He is wondering if he can return the car *before* the week (he got it Friday) as he doesn't want to keep it around, now that he has (his own) one. To my understanding, he met the 20 ride cap and the weekly charge, just doesn't want to get charged for next week.

We both read online that there is a one week minimum but we're not quite sure what this means? For example Uber still charges for the full week but at least lets you return the car early. Wondering if Lyft is any similar in that regard and if anyone knows for sure.

TLDR: ExpressDrive, can we return it after a few days (less than a week)?

By now it is clear that Lyft and Uber are transportation companies, but they want you to think they are tech companies. In practice, they are really companies concerned with arbitrage. They want employees but don't want to dish out any of the benefits. In this case, they want to shove off liability in case something goes wrong. It is sad to say but this doesn't improve community safety, it just discredits RAINN, if anything.  

What's gross about lyft can be seen in how they talk to drivers and to a lesser extent, passengers. Drivers are part of a community. That is until a car breaks down or a serious incident occurs. Once shit gets real we are no longer treasured members of the driver community, we are what we really are: independent contractors. 

As a final note I'm not sure calling 911 thru the app is a good idea. This is a pretty bogus feature considering that any phone, even ones without contracts, are able to call 911. It seems to me more likely that calling 911 thru the lyft app would interfere with the call in some way.

1573062362,Lyft,"I've seen a couple of posts complaining about the flexdrive program but I wanted to submit one because I ignored the warnings. So I hadn't driven for lyft in a couple of years and never drove in the current city I am in. Back when I did drive, I was using my own car which was a totally different experience. 

So I was really excited when I got my car and was ready to start working. I saw the \~$230 (it actually ends up being \~$270) a week and figured that I must make more than that during a week of driving lyft for them to charge me this much. With school/job searching during the day I'll drive on my off hours and make enough to not have to worry about money for a while at least. 

I've seen reports of Lyft giving people who drive for the flexdrive program less wages on top of taking away \~$270 a week and I completely believe it. I would say that driving for lyft under this program averaged out to be probably a $15/hr job which does not make it worth the $270 a week they take out of your wages. You might as well rent a car or lease something for this price, or you could go do literally anything else for work. In Seattle, I was trying to drive commuter hours and as often as I could but there was plenty of time where I ended up sitting in my car or driving around to orange areas only for them to disappear. This is not Lyft's fault I understand but just a warning that you won't be making money for a good amount of time that you're sitting in your car. 

So Lyft takes this $270 a week out every monday which means that every week you start at a negative and have to slog, typically at least 4-5 days of driving, until you make that amount and start actually earning. During this time, Lyft will also take the toll amounts out of your bank account. They claim that the tolls are paid for in the rider's fare which is true but when you are doing your weekly slog not earning anything, that toll is just getting subtracted from your bank account with a happy little receipt message from Lyft a couple of times a week. :) :) :)

Yes, Lyft was good about paying you quickly once you did start earning. Yes, Lyft was a good experience for me to get out of the house and earn at least a little bit of money and not have to rely on my husband. Yes, Lyft was a good way for me to explore a new city. 

But ultimately the fees are too much. I'm currently fighting for my deposit back. Flexdrive's own receipt says that I returned the car in exactly the same condition I received it in and yet my deposit is down \~$100. Lyft's customer service is abysmal and so when I finally did get through to somebody on the phone they just told me they couldn't help me and I had to contact flexdrive directly. Surprise surprise Flexdrive isn't getting back to me. 

All in all I feel like $270 a week is theft. If you wanted to rent a car for that amount of money you might as well be spending your money to actually own the car. If you are driving full time and sitting on the road for 9 hours a day then the program might work for you. If you don't have any other source of income and you're looking for something to make some money while you look for a job I do not recommend Lyft Expressdrive.

I decided to drive in an area I don't usually drive in, the area showed $4, 6, $7 Etc.
 Yet on my phone it kept saying minimum surge next ride $11, at the same time it was running a three consecutive ride bonus, long story short is of course they never came up with three rides though they did attempt to send me to a McDonald's.
 i am asking why and how after just one ride does it say
""guaranteed 11.00 minimum surge next ride""...as i am showing a map area at 5.75.?

This might be long. 
. Get a call from Diamond! I was excited because it's usually one of the ladies of the night or maybe the strip club! They always tip $20.00, even on a bad night they still give you a $3 tip! I get there and it turns out not to be any of my regular ladies.   

It was 3 beautiful ladies, they were dressed in African attire, looking so beautiful, so many different colors of the rainbow, yellow, red, maroon, burgundy. One of them I could tell had a slight hump back and walked with a limp. I felt bad for her right away because people with disabilities work extra hard. 

 As they got into my car, I noticed that the lady with the humpback wasn't getting into the car correctly. She was literally leaning all the way over but for some reason couldn't put her knees up, I thought maybe it was due to her disability.  

 They all got in, one in the front and the other two in the back, then I asked them their names and ask them to all click their seatbelts. The lady with the hump on her back didn't move. I turned around and I told her ""you are precious cargo, I must make sure I get you there in one piece please click your seatbelt"".   

She had a little waist so I knew it would be no problem to bring that belt down and bring it across your waist. She looked at me funny.   

At that moment she grabbed the cloth of her dress and pulled it around and her hump on her back moved to her side but as it moved to her side it also started kicking! Right at that moment I thought to myself WTF! She had a baby wrapped up in her dress!   


 I looked at her and said ""lady your hump is moving viciously and has moved to the side of your underarm! The lady in the front giggled!  

 At that moment I asked the ladies did they have a car seat for the baby! All three of them shook their heads no in unison. I asked them to please step out of the car and that I could not take them with a baby with no car seat.   

As they were climbing out of the car and I was letting the timer run out I started laughing hysterically and I couldn't stop.

 I got a message while I was waiting it was the lady asking me to hurry up and cancel the ride so that she could call another car right away because I was holding her up.   

I didn't answer,  I just let the time run out. I called CS and ask them to unpair me and let them know about the baby with no car seat and even the little customer service guy begin to laugh at the story. SMDH!",Tale of the humpback!

1570660482,Lyft,"Let me first start by saying this is my 1st reddit post, I also rarely if ever do things like Yelp reviews or go out of my way to complain about services, companies, etc, but my recent Lyft ride from hell gave me inspiration to be a redditor.  It was a normal Friday at work, I wanted to buy a new DJ controller &amp; trade in my old one to a local DJ shop in San Francisco.  I requested a Lyft &amp; 5 minutes later Rosaldo showed up in his white Prius to pick me up along with my DJ controller in a case.  I loaded the case in his trunk &amp; we were off on a 10 minute trip to Market street.  As soon as I got in Rosaldo inquired about the destination, thinking it used to be a music venue, I told him I wasn't sure since I'm relatively new to the City which later lead to me telling him where I'm from along with where I currently live.  Shortly after I asked the same questions, he said he was from Brazil &amp; has been in the City for 5 years, I then asked what area he lives in which lead to Rosaldo saying: ""I don't have to tell you where I live, why the fuck are you asking.""  In that instance I was in shock thinking he was joking but the stare down immediately after made me aware he was not joking whatsoever.  I was dropped off about a minute later &amp; as I was getting out I made the comment: ""You know you're kind of an asshole for driving people around for a living, but it was a pleasure, hope you have a better day.""  I was in the process of unloading my case from the trunk when Rosaldo floored the gas pedal which lead to me falling forward in the street.  As soon as I got up I realized what he was doing so I chased after him down a side street to try &amp; get my equipment out of his car.  I got close but he drove into on coming traffic to flee the scene.  I called the police to explain the situation which later lead to a police report saying that Rosaldo cause me to fall in the street &amp; stole my equipment.  I contacted Lyft support via the app explaining the situation in detail which later lead to a barrage of BS emails from Lyft support.  About 3 hours later I received a text from Kira at the Lyft hub as well as an automated text from a (855) 529-5676 number telling me that good news, Rosaldo was kind enough to return my lost item &amp; for the drivers inconvenience I will be charged a $15 fee.  I was livid at that point &amp; replied to the various emails from support letting them know how upset I was &amp; at the very least I wanted the $15 refunded along with a ride credit.  This whole situation lasted almost 2 weeks before I finally got a resolution.  I eventually drove to the hub where I picked up my gear, while I was there I wanted to talk to a supervisor, someone face to face to have this whole thing resolved.  All I got was that I needed to contact the lost &amp; found department via text or email to dispute the charges.  After numerous texts &amp; emails I finally got a lengthy text telling me that safety is one of Lyft's main concerns but they cannot refund me the money or off any kind of credit.

I'm  trying to make this express drive thing work financially. I hate renting, but I need to make it work somehow. Otherwise I'll never be able to get my car fixed, or get a new one.   


Two Uber renters I spoke to say they always go for Uber's rental bonus. Do Lyft Express Drivers do the same  with rental rewards? I can do 85 rides for $75. The top two tiers (105 for $45) and (135 for another $80) seem nearly impossible for me.   


I would have to take a lot of short rides and Shared rides, and that seems counterproductive. But is that the key to making money with Express Drive? What am I missing?  


I know some will say there's no way to make money renting, or that I should get a 9 to 5. But like I said, right now I have no other options. I just quit my 9 to 5 for family reasons.

1570452877,Lyft,"Around 2:30 am this morning I got pinged to a gated community. I almost cancelled at the gate because it took the security guard about 10 minutes to let me in, but I was trapped with cars behind me, so I had to wait anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

As I pulled up to the cul-de-sac, there were at least three police cruisers and maybe 10 people outside, apparently waiting for rides.

&amp;#x200B;

An officer asked me who I was there for, I told him the female name on the app, he called out the name, and a female officer came over with three young women. 

&amp;#x200B;

She asked me to verify the two addresses on the app with the riders, and told me to make sure they got home safe. Okay.

&amp;#x200B;

One (or all of them) had an obvious alcohol smell, but I didn't think much of it until one of them started calling other people who were at the party and asking things like ""do you think you'll get in trouble with your mom?"" and ""we need to coordinate our answers"".

&amp;#x200B;

That led me to believe they might be underage, so I asked the one sitting in the front seat which college they went to, and she told me the name of a high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if anyone was over 18. Crickets. Then one in the back said she'll be 18 in December. To be fair, there was one sleeping in the back who I don't think spoke during the entire trip. She might have been over 18 or maybe even over 21, but that's not the impression I got. 

&amp;#x200B;

By then we were four minutes from the first stop, so there was no use in turning back.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gathered a neighbor called the police over loud noise. I'm not sure what steps the cops took after they got there, but these girls appeared to have been drinking, and appeared to be under age to ride without an adult as well.   


I was paying attention to the female officer, so I didn't see the faces of the riders as they got in the car to determine how young or old they looked, but ultimately I was the one who was put at risk.   


Perhaps the officers looked the other way because this happened in an upper class neighborhood? I don't know. Or maybe they did their due diligence and the girl that was sleeping was indeed old enough to drink and she was the one who smelled like booze. And if she was over 18 or 21, that would make the ride perfectly legal I guess. But in the moment I didn't get that impression.   


I will send Lyft a detailed note of what happened just to have it documented, although I know they don't care and will do nothing.  


This is not the first time the cops put drunk people in my car, but this one seemed excessively weird by all accounts, especially for a Monday morning. Each day I learn a new lesson. Next time I'll be sure to ask the police officers all necessary questions.

One (or all of them) had an obvious alcohol smell, but I didn't think much of it until one of them started calling other people who were at the party and asking things like ""do you think you'll get in trouble with your mom?"" and ""we need to coordinate our answers""..

That's when I asked the one sitting in the front seat which college they went to, and she told me the name of their high school.

I asked if anyone was over 18. Crickets. Then one in the back said she'll be 18 in December.

By then we were four minutes from the first stop, so there was no use in turning back.

So clearly the police knew they were underage to drink, and underage to ride in a Lyft, and decided to look the other way and potentially put me at risk, perhaps because this happened in an upper class neighborhood.

I will send Lyft a detailed note of what happened just to have it documented, although I know they don't care and will do nothing.

This is not the first time the cops put drunk people in my car, but this one seemed excessively stupid by all accounts. Each day I learn a new lesson.",The Cops just put three underage drunk girls in my car. WTF.

I did some quick calculations and figured that they had to be going to the airport, which even though it was a long drive to them, the fare to the airport would make everything worth it.   


So I drive to their house, they give me the gate code to their neighborhood, I pull up, call them, tell them that I arrive, and then I wait. and wait. The timer runs out and instead of calling them again, I just gun it. I don't care anymore. I'm tired of these people treating my time like it's worthless.

1570359004,Lyft,"Hi Reddit --

I am hoping someone could provide some clarity on how to tell if a Lyft driver is still active or not.

If a driver is suspended or their account is no longer active, can a passenger click on their Ride History and see the driver's profile picture? Or is it just a empty placeholder?

I attached a screenshot of an old Ride History. See how everyone's pictures shows up and you can click on any one of them to get more details on the Trip History. If the driver in question was no longer driving (suspended or whatever), will their picture still appear there? Or nah?

Anyone have experience with this -- whether it's a PAX or driver who was suspended for a short time?

1570303812,Lyft,"Might have to get ready for a wall of text. Tbh I wasn’t gonna tell this tale before, outta sheer laziness,  but the way it broke my heart just compelled me to. 
I just couldn’t help but feel empathy for the callers. 
Thought that I got lucky I never was in any of those situations, I could’ve easily been, as I used to drive with simple liability and I’m a lone migrant who needed an entry level job while he settled down in the US. I have lived in the US for a whopping 2 years. Used to drive, didn’t have many options. Had a racist manager who hated Hispanics, so I figured hey... lyft can’t be worse than that, right? 
First of all, let’s just say I’m in a position (now) where I see lots of insurance claims. Obviously I can’t discuss specific names or dates, and I gotta be as vague as possible, but these two tales are 100% true. 

First call was a Mexican driver, calling insurance company to try and find a way to have someone take responsibility for his car. He shares his tale
He dropped off someone at the airport while doing uber and started heading home. He runs a red light and hits a car. Admits to the wrongdoing, after all, he knew it was his fault. He doesn’t give it a second thought. I have full coverage he thinks, and apologizes and exchanges information with the other driver. 

Later finds out his insurance refuses to pay any damages , “ you were in the app, it’s Uber’s responsibility ( yes first tale was an uber driver, second was a lyft driver) “ he, desperately calls the other company, the one that insured the person he hit. “ why are you claiming I was logged into uber while I was driving, it’s not true, plz tell my insurance it isn’t true so they fix my car “ 
All he receives is a “ this is what uber claims, not us, we can’t do anything” 
His car was a 2019, probably just bought it, on which he owed a lot of money, and as he stated many times, the source of income of his family. The only source, which he needs fixed asap. 
He just breaks down before they hung up. 
I can’t say for sure if he was logged on or not, I have no access to that data. 
I can say, however, that the second story was way more tragic.  At least for me...Because... 

Well, second caller was a lyft driver. I believe Dominican he had full coverage. He was calling his own insurance company, and was connected to a claims rep about an accident. They were apparently denying coverage entirely.  This is what he said “ when I got insurance to drive for lyft, your sales rep told me I needed a special insurance, that cost $50 extra a month, I pay almost $300 a month to be fully insured, why won’t you fix my car? “ 

Some other driver hit him, he was 0% liable for the accident. However, he had passengers and was in the middle of a lyft drive. 
His rep explained “ the coverage you signed up for only protects you in the event that you are logged into the app but have no passengers. The moment you pick up somebody, it’s lyft’s responsibility” 
He began swearing. Yelling, saying lift is doing nothing, that he is losing wages. That he won’t be able to pay rent, feed his family, anything “
Please, I can’t wait, I need my car, I paid you so much in insurance” . He was in complete disbelief that his $300 monthly insurance would not cover any damages in an accident that he was 0% liable for. He just begun breaking down. The conversation went in circles , with the same statement just being said over and over. You are not covered. 

There is a third story. One girl told me how she had an accident and it took about 4 months before lyft repaid her like $20,000 of out-of-pocket expenses. And never returned it entirely. 
This was back when I still drove for lyft, and she was my passenger. 
Before I made the decision to sell my car and do a 9-5 and never look back. 
Never been better, and I feel for the people here stuck doing it. Just get out of it while you can, there is a lot of fine print that just might fuck you up.

I can afford to get a luxury sedan around 20K or an older 2010 Chevy Tahoe for around the same price. The luxury sedan would allow me to drive for Lyft Lux whereas the 2012 Tahoe would allow me to drive for Lyft XL.

I’m curious to know if anyone has had their luggage stolen by a ridesharing driver. This recently happened to a friend on a trip to Phoenix, AZ. It was the first time I heard about this type of theft. After sharing this link with him--[https://fymhotsauce.rocks/blogs/news/my-uber-driver-robbed-me-so-i-took-uber-to-court-and-won](https://fymhotsauce.rocks/blogs/news/my-uber-driver-robbed-me-so-i-took-uber-to-court-and-won)\--my friend told me this was similar to his experience with the driver immediately leaving with the luggage in the trunk after he exited the car. After contacting Uber, he was told that because the drivers were independent contractors, they were not liable for any losses and that he, the passenger, had to work it out with the driver. The driver never responded to any calls or voice messages, and the luggage has not been recovered. He filed a police report including the driver’s name, license plate, and car model. The author on the linked article investigated, filed a complaint in small claims court, and eventually won his court case.  I’m wondering what the statistics for occurrence and outcome for others have been.

· If your luggage was stolen, what action did you take? 

· Were you able to get your luggage and the contents back?

Any advice?,Lost my car keys in a lyft
1567617349,Lyft,"I guess I've been mostly lucky, but I would have to say yesterday was one of the worst rides I've had.  It was an airport pick-up at about 6:30 in the morning.

First, there was a distinct smell of what seemed like cigarette smoke in the car.  This definitely exacerbated my sinus issues and cold and headache from the redeye flight that I took.

Second, leaving IAH he either cut off a guy or was cut off and called the other driver a n---er, but then quickly apologized as that other driver sped past us.

Third, he texted a more than a few times (at least three) and made a call to his 16 yo daughter warning her of post Labor Day traffic to which she responded there is traffic every weekday. Also showed pic of son and daughter which I assumed was ploy for bigger tip.  There was a hard brake slam due to the texting also.

Fourth, he kept bragging and would not shut up about how he was a great driver and taking the best and fastest route of highway 59 (hov) to the southwest side of Houston. He also nearly missed my exit (crossed 4 lanes) an then he complained about how should have told him about taking Beltway 8 since it would have been faster and how I was unclear on my final destination (home) and the Lyft app does not show final destination on pick-up.

Lastly, he continually made just plain weird racial comments.  He was from Sri Lanka and the concentration of  apartment between 610 and BW8 are decreasing property values and wondered if we lived in an apartment as he dropped us off (since we live in house adjacent to apartments) and that living in a Chinese neighborhood (which we do) is good. He also said I looked Mexican (which I am not).

He got us home in 50 minutes for $43 plus $8 tip which is $30 cheaper than can fare without tip.  However, I wonder if it was worth it considering the crappy level of service and safety.",Oddest Lyft Ride Ever!

1567059370,Lyft,"I’ve just started the express program after the countless lyfters I used exclaimed the joys of working ‘independently’ and the great cash they were receiving.  They explained between 5-6 days a week were on the road; various hours.  While a few said they averaged between 60-70 hrs, most were selling me on the 40-50 hr range.  But after driving for the last three days I ask myself how anyone could do this without some form of schedule or further how could you schedule this to have freedom in your life?  It would appear you have to get up during the ass crack of dawn, take a break in the day, then be right back on the road no later than 4.  Even after perhaps coming up with some kind of plan to earn, the rides you grab locally only pay out between 3.60-10 (and $10 is really pushing it) with the average of zero tips.  They expect you to pay over $1000 dollars a month to rent the vehicle, not including the gas, or reach the tier program where they ‘deduct’ amounts off the rental costs.  Prime example - 70 rides gets you $70 off the $260 base price.  That’s not a lot of money off considering the gas factor from the daily drives.  You can’t tap into any money you make until the rental costs are covered for the week.. which I can assume means that you’d have to hustle the first two-three days (9-10 hrs of waiting around for pings that pay you decently..) and what, use the other 4-5 days to cover the gas you’ve used up, food, and cleaning supplies for the car to keep it nice.  

I had issues when I would read lyfters on here getting upset, but the truth is for lyft express I can understand the frustration.  They’re taking 60% of your rides - especially on the longer runs, which if they don’t tip, leaves you in the wake of tears. Having your own car and doing this would make a lot more sense and be extremely practical to earn extra money for the household.  Lyft express however appears to be some sort of financial tactic to lure in people who don’t have vehicles at the moment and tell them it’s incredibly easy to fund renting the car all the while making tons of money which is a blatant white lie.  You can earn money, you’re just going to give up your life in the process.

If lyft had any practical sense of keeping lyft express alive they’d need to change this rate situation.  The base rate for the month should be $300-400 vs the $1000 they ask.  Most of us have our own insurance.. and Jesus Christ don’t get me started on the thousand dollar out of pocket deductible if forbid you’ve gotten into any kind of accident (whether at fault or not).  Legitimately seems very scheme oriented and not user friendly. 

Anyway love to hear some personal opinions if anyone else just started express!",New driver for express. Advice or truth?

1564860128,Lyft,"Is there anyway to change pickup/dropoff locations as a driver?  I just started driving this past week, and last night a situation arose where the location pin's weren't exactly spot on and the app wouldn't let me start/end the ride without being at the exact location.  

I was picking up a group of guys coming out of a bar, but they had walked across the street to a 7/11 to buy a few things.  They requested the ride at the bars address, but sent me a note to pick them up at the 7/11....no big deal, it was close enough and actually more convenient for me not having to cross traffic.   I pull up and they get in, and I go to arrive/confirm the pickup but it wasn't an option because I wasn't where the app thought I should be...I tried flipping through the menu's but couldn't find an option to override it or anything.  I asked the guy who requested the ride to go through his app to see if there was a way to edit the pickup on his end, but either there wasn't an option or he was too drunk to figure it out (probly the latter). We ended up just driving back across the street to get close enough to the initial pin and I arrived/confirmed there.  

The destination was another bar a few miles away, but it was in a very busy town square and traffic was jammed up, so they asked me to drop them off at the corner and they would walk the rest of the way (faster and more convenient for both parties).  They hopped out quickly, and again I had no way of ""arriving"" without being in some close proximity of the pin.  I know there's definitely an option to get the pax to change destination on their phone, but they were walking away by the time I realized I couldn't end the ride.  There was a button to exit/end the ride, but I wasn't sure if that was the same as arriving at the destination, and I didn't want Lyft to think I was bailing on the pax and not taking them where they wanted to go according to GPS.  So I ended up driving through traffic to get to the actual address and ended once I got close enough.  

What can I do to avoid this in the future?  There should be an option for the passenger to edit locations, but it's kinda silly to not let the driver do the same (within reason).  I drive late at night and most of my passengers are drunks (which I actually don't mind as long as their not sloppy), so it would make sense to give the driver some additional functionality in case the pax is too drunk to figure it out.",How to change pickup/dropoff locations (as a driver)?

There are various changes throughout that I haven't fully gone through. Claimants are no longer required to pay all their arbitration fees which is good, and Lyft no longer guarantees you may arbitrate only documentation/telephone for claims less than $10,000 which is bad.

The main thing that stood out to me is actually absent in both the existing and upcoming terms. [b]There is no exception for binding arbitration when it comes to cases of sexual harassment.[/b] As it says in the terms the new agreement supersedes any older one, so this gives them the legal tool to continue using mandatory arbitration when dealing with any cases of sexual assault.

1564845031,Lyft,"This happens quite a bit so I thought I'd ask about it. I use ride share a lot and have always preferred lyft just because I drove for them when they first established in LV. Everyone I know, and more and more people I talk to prefer Uber. I think the reason why that is, it's definitely the reason I'm making the switch, is efficiency.
Tell me why they can't get the shared ride situation together? Uber has mastered it. Why, if my driver is on the freeway and we have passed the exit he needs for the next driver, it won't automatically cancel and ping a closer driver. Even if my driver is technically closer, he has to take a further exit, and drive all the way around, and anyone in Vegas traffic knows that's not always an quick, easy thing to do. It adds 20min to my ride, it makes the requested rider wait 20min instead of just getting them a new driver. If the rider cancels they are charged. I'm sorry but getting a ride is expensive enough, paying for one you don't get is unacceptable. 
Anyways, there is also always problems with the GPS and I'm sure drivers get the brunt of it with low ratings and less tips. They are losing customers and drivers to uber, they need to get it together.",Lyft efficiency

1564819162,Lyft,"I have an app on my phone that allows me to give rides for money. 

You have an app on your phone that lets you get a ride in exchange for money.

Lyft/Uber own a server that matches clients and subcontractors. Each ride is a subcontract threw Lyft/Uber. passengers are Lyft/Uber clients and i am a subcontractor.

Lyft/Uber takes far too much money for their role in what they do (matching subcontractors and clients) between the two parties involved. They should be legally capped at 20% or less. IMO they should get more than 10%. They offer little more than an app that matches two people together and processes payment.

#deleteuberlyft and stuff like that are meaningless to the corporate giants. You are hurting your neighbor like that... Please tell me what platform you want me to give you rides on, im not a fan of what these giants do either but you are cutting out your neighbors in an attempt to boycott the tech giants...

Uber/Lyft drivers are background checked and we are all independent of uber and lyft. We arent criminals, proven, and we arent the tech giants who you feel are screwing you over...

I hate this driver vs passenger type thing im seeing in the media. I am absolutely positive both companies believe that if they create a divide between drivers and passengers then they would be able to shift frustrations off of them onto the other parties and would be in a better position to take larger amounts of money from both the passenger and the driver.

To them, its all about what a passenger is willing to pay, and how much a driver is willing to give up. You cannot forget that. 

They are trying to make us enemies when we are on the same team. Ebay, offerup, craigslist, match, okcupid, usedbikes, ect ect.... Every single one of these websites or apps offer a service that matches people with common interests and goals. NONE of them get away with taking as large of a total cost % as Lyft and Uber do. These companies are operating in a criminal manner, in my opinion. They cannot justify the need for such large profit margins when at the end of the year they keep losing money anyways and we all know its from over zealus marketing and poorly strategies bonus incentives (i loved those easy bonuses as a driver but do u guys remember the 500$ for 70 rides a week thing?

He says that he was riding back to his home last night and arguing with his wife on the phone. As they were getting closer to his destination he says that he asked the driver 'which road he was taking' since there has been an on going road work on the route that the driver was following. He is a sweet guy and I have no doubt that his intentions where good but English is not his native language so he might not have come across polite, I don't know I wasn't there but he says that he was not yelling or raising his voice, he was just asking him a question.

He says that the driver told him ""whatever route the GPS is telling me"". I think that the driver was already irritated with him arguing on the phone in another language, which is what the driver told him later on, I will come back to this, and he might have felt being questioned and maybe even offended I am not sure. My buddy asks the driver to take the next street as the street that the GPS is asking them is closed. At that point the driver asks him to leave the car and says ""you were already arguing on the phone when you got into my car and just leave already"". My buddy doesn't want to leave, they are about 2-3 blocks away from his destination and he says just drive me to the address on the GPS. The driver pulls over and says ""GTFO my car"". At this point my buddy pulls out his phone and asks him to repeat what he said but the driver doesn't do that, it is not a video btw, he was voice recording. The driver gets out of his seat, physically removes my buddy from the car and rips his shirt off and scratches his arm while doing so. My buddy gets upset and they get into a fist fight.

1564505425,Lyft,,Here are some of the reasons why I think Lyft is worse than Uber. Do you agree?
1564504410,Lyft,"So I've never used Lyft or uber before, but was in need of a ride to a concert on short notice tonight, so I used to the schedule feature to set up a ride later this afternoon. Being a new user, my main concern is that it's a long trip (35ish miles, could take up to an hour with traffic), and I want to make sure the driver is aware of that to avoid irking anyone. I heard that when you use the schedule feature, the driver can see a rough estimate of pick up and drop off locations, as well as an estimate of how long the trip is, before they accept. Is this true? 

My ride was accepted pretty quickly, but I dont see any contact info for my driver. Is this not available until closer to my pick up time? I'd like to send them a message making sure they're OK with the trip length in advance if possible. Thanks and sorry for the noob questions.","First time Lyft user, question about scheduled ride"
1564500038,Lyft,"So I signed up for Lyft, and added my debit card. It accepted it, but when I requested a ride it then asks me to add a new card that matches the billing address to the card I already had on file.

I only have one debit card with my bank, so I just added my husband’s debit card. It accepted it so I thought everything would be all good now, until I tried to request a ride again. It tells me once again to add a new card..... 

Billing address is exactly the same, both cards had enough money on them, and they are not prepaid cards so I’m not sure why it keeps asking me to add a new card.

I contact customer service, and they told me to just follow the prompts. I told them I did exactly what the prompts told me to do, and it’s still asking me to add a new card. They told me again, “sorry but you have to follow the prompts”. 

We don’t have any other cards. Do I need to just delete my account on Lyft and stop trying? I don’t know what else to do, since customer support are not helpful. Anyone else have this issue?","Lyft keeps asking me to add a new card, after I already added a new one."

1564435893,Lyft,"On Saturday July 27th I ordered a Lyft to the designated pickup in Downtown Las Vegas. Once the driver accepted the ride it showed that he was located on a street a block away and would need to make a few turns to get to us. We stood on the street where the Lyfts are supposed to drive by to pick us up. After about 5 minutes the driver never moved or called and I got a notification that the ride was cancelled. I quickly ordered another Lyft and the driver was near the same location and picked up up quickly. 

The next day I received a notification that I would be charged 5 dollars for a cancellation. I emailed Lyft and told them I was never called and could provide a call log to prove that. I also told them that the driver never moved from where he was. The support agent gave me what sounded like a pre-typed message about drivers needing gas. I emailed again and he said the driver told him he tried to call twice and drove around the neighborhood looking for us. 

Basically I got told to kick rocks about the subject but my next questions are. Should I call my credit card company and have them remove the cancellation charge since this is a false charge? Is there a way to talk to someone higher up than a standard support agent? I feel like he didn’t listen to what I had to say or even recognize my evidence. 

TL;DR - Driver charged a cancellation fee but never moved his car or called me to see where I was. Support staff seems unhelpful and I’m not sure if I should dispute the charge with my credit card company.",Driver charged cancellation but never moved or showed up

At this point we assumed we did something wrong and looked at the app and couldn't find anything like that, so we cancelled the ride at the request of the driver.  We choose the same exact settings, economy 4 person Lyft.  Another driver got our request.

The driver in our parking lot was not very happy and told us to cancel the request with the new car and try again so that he could get the ride.

My question is, did we do something wrong that we can avoid in the future?

1564356294,Lyft,"I've been driving for Lyft for about 2 years now in the SF Bay Area, and in 870 rides, the worst experience I had with Lyft was a lady spilling part of her soda on my back seat. It has truly been an adventure every day I log in to the driver app and am ready to start driving, I'm sure you guys know the feeling. (I don't get that feeling quite like that anymore, but I still appreciate travelling from San Jose to SF and getting paid for it and just generally going all over the Bay Area.)

The community has been excellent, and the platform has been much better than Uber in the sense that Lyft actually seems to care more about their drivers than Uber does. I started driving with an 05 Camry and actually financed a 2017 Corolla after a year + just so I could use it for ridesharing, I was having such success. 

Anyways I just wanted to say how sad I would be if I ever got deactivated from Lyft because I have met so many cool, positive people while driving from literally all over the Bay Area, and received so much appreciation in the form of tips and even Thank Yous! One thing that really impressed me about ridesharing starting out coming from customer service, is that after every ride, everyone; from older people to teenage kids, would genuinely say thank you when the ride was over. I worked as a cashier and obviously the attitude is different towards retail/food service, but to see that more personal side of people really impressed me starting out. (The occasional $20 tips really impressed me too when I was making $13 an hour as a server) 

But yeah, apparently my account has been flagged for two reasons lately, 
1) Cancelling too often
and
2)Getting contacted by passengers after you've tapped to pick them up, which is completely out of my control. I'm not sure about other markets but here in the Bay Area, it's not uncommon for people to call Lyfts for their parents, girlfriend, boyfriend, co-worker, etc. 

The funny thing about that is that their number spoofing system is broken right now and I don't even receive a call and then when they get in my car they say they've been calling and I have received nothing. Which is unrelated to the issue above but just a quirky thing, I don't even get calls but somehow Lyft detects them calling.","Lately Lyft has been giving me crap about things out of my control, but I would really like to continue driving."

1564343126,Lyft,"Went to the Hollywood Bowl Saturday Night for a sold out event.  We took Uber from a local restaurant (Desert Sun) to the venue and it worked out well.  We tried to take Uber or Lyft from the venue after the event and it was a disaster.  We finally got an Uber 1 hour later back to the restaurant.  This was my first and second time using ride-share and the second time did not go well, so I have questions.

I chose the Reddit Lyft forum because the Hollywood Bowl seemed to want me to use it.  At the exit they have Lyft direction signs, a Lyft waiting area and 2 Lyft vested people helping out.  So I logged into my Lyft app (which I had installed, but never tried) and waited for a nearby driver.  Three separate times I had a driver on the way (5 minutes), but all 3 drivers eventually cancelled the ride.  I noticed very few cars were coming in to pick up people until about 11:45 when all of them arrived at once.  As I said, we eventually got an Uber and I noticed EVERY nearby parking lot was empty!  To me, it looks like the Hollywood Bowl staff gave precedence to all of the nearby parking areas and treated the ride-share cars as lowest priority.  Is this normal?  What should we have done differently?  Should we have gone to a different pick up area or called ahead or taken a cab?

1561820213,Lyft,"Hi everyone , I just have a quick question 

I’m away from home on a summer job contract with no vehicle. Up until now , I’ve been carpooling with a coworker , but his car broke down on our way home yesterday so I’m out of a ride for at least the next week . It’s looking like I’ll need to use Lyft to get home, and I’m really nervous because I’ve never done it alone before. I’m a pretty small petite woman, so being in any situation where I feel like I have no control , ESPECIALLY with strangers terrifies me . My job doesn’t allow us to bring weapons (as in mace) onto the premises so I have nothing with me except my keys if something goes wrong. I’ve heard so many instances of people being harmed by their Uber/Lyft driver. I don’t know if they’re isolated , but it’s enough to make me anxious . So how safe is Lyft? Do drivers go through extensive background checks, fingerprinting included? How do I keep myself safe riding alone? I planned on calling a friend and having someone else track my ride just to be on the safe side. Is it safer to sit up front, in the back, or does it not matter? I can usually find a ride TO work with no problem (I don’t mind going in earlier and sitting for an hour) but getting home is the issue because I finish a lot later than my other coworkers , and no one is willing to make a 12 minute drive to come get me (despite me offering gas money). To be fair , it’s not their responsibility and I’m well aware of that, but I’ve expressed my safety concerns to them and no one will budge, leaving me no other choice but to Uber or Lyft . Since I’ll only be living in this city for the summer, I’m not familiar with their taxi service or else I’d call a taxi . I just have some preconceived notions (and valid concerns) about riding alone and I want to keep myself as safe as possible .

I had to take the day off to clean it all up (they got it all over my seats ugh) and I contacted Lyft about getting paid for the damages. So far they have not responded to a single inquiry I have made as to whether or not the cost of the damages would be covered.

Since Sunday I have sent three emails along the same email chain and they haven't responded to any of them.

They contacted me on Monday via text to let me know that evidently that passenger had left their glasses in my car. I informed Lyft that they had not and asked when I would get a response from them about covering the damages and they simply replied that they would let me know soon.

Confused that the driver didn't arrive at the designated meeting spot, I called and texted him several times. He never answered any of the calls or text messages. I also tried jogging toward the area where the driver was using his location on the app, but there was just not enough time on the timer (all the while, I was calling the driver).

Even though I don't regularly use Lyft, I figured that buying a Lyft Pass would pay for itself in the two rides I was planning on taking (less than 3 miles; about $3-4 WITH the pass). Unfortunately, Lyft is demanding I add a second card to my account which I don't have.   


No big deal. I go ahead and purchase a gift card for my account. That payment goes through without a problem.  


Then the problems begin.  


1. My $10 credit appears in the app and ""no restrictions"" is listed underneath. Yet, the $4 discount on my rides from my ride pass doesn't show when I go to reserve a ride. I purchased a GIFT CARD. If I went into Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon, they would discount my purchase and let me pay with the gift card. 
2. I am still unable to get a ride because a $10 giftcard is not enough to cover a $7 ride (that should be $3). 
3. I have tried putting my debit card in manually and going via Google and PayPal. I thought PayPal almost worked, but Lyft tried charging the card on file $15 for a ride that was listed as ""FREE"" under my fare estimator. I don't have that $15 in my bank account because I've already paid it to Lyft. I have a bank deposit pending, but those funds will not be available until tomorrow.

Also just had my best session driving the other night in downtown Orlando near the Disney area, was about to go home then got 5 back to back tips driving people back from the Disney parks.

1558761253,Lyft,"In the midst of the Uber/Lyft strike with drivers not logging on, I’ve heard many passengers calling us crybabies, and that we should stop complaining, and how we should get a real job if we don’t like what we do. 

This post is to illustrate an example on how driver’s and passengers are actually on the same team. 

I’ll get right to the point. 

The following screenshots are from surge at SFO.

This is what we [see](https://imgur.com/a/wxtaWZy).

This is what you [see](https://imgur.com/a/33ggrda).

Bear in mind that a ride from SFO to Fort Mason is around 32 bucks, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/3vJbEsH). Drivers make about 19 dollars from that 32 dollar fare. $5 of that fare goes to SFO, which means we make 19 and Lyft makes 8. Depending on the driver, our commission is supposed to be 20 to 25 percent. In this example, it’s about 30 percent.

Ask yourself, why are you paying nearly double (93 percent more in this example), when the driver only gets $5.50 of it? Well, our surge is flat now, which means we get that amount no matter where you go.

Here is a screenshot ten minutes or so later, when the surge has gone down from $5.50 to $2.25.

What we [see](https://imgur.com/a/1UOnQy7).

What you [see](https://imgur.com/a/j3uPWnf).

Wait, what??

All of sudden, our surge earnings have cut in half, from $5.50 to $2.25, a difference of $3.25.

Meanwhile, what you pay goes down from $58.18 to $36.90, a difference of $21.28.

So what does this mean? 

It means Uber is shortchanging the drivers. They’re charging true surge multiplier pricing, and only giving the drivers a few dollars in this example.

You might be saying to yourself, “what the driver makes has nothing to with me.” While it’s true that there isn’t a correlation between what you pay and what we earn, I’ll give you the kicker: they are short changing drivers, while charging YOU, THE PASSENGER, ridiculous fares. In the end, WE BOTH GET SCREWED OVER. This is how Uber/Lyft is going to turn a profit! Wake up!

Like I said from the beginning, drivers and passengers are on the same team. They don’t care about either of us. At the end of the day, they are out to protect their bottom line.

I'm in a city population f about 250k, and from what I can tell, about 90% of rides have pick-up points within about a 5 minute radius of our downtown area. I also happen to live inside that area.  So basically, if I pick someone up in that circle, and the ride is more than 10 to 12 minutes, I know with almost certainty that I'm going to have about a 10 minute return trip to the only sure pick up area with no chance of getting another ride along the way, thus doubling every ride's distance but only getting paid for half of it, not even including the travel time to the original pick up.  am I missing something? Or am I just at a disadvantage that I live in a city where rides are not being requested all over it?

the other day I drove 5 minutes to go pick up this guy, and he had me drive him about 20 minutes out of the city to the middle of nowhere. and since there was no possibility of getting a ride anywhere near the drop off, the whole thing turned into about a 45 minutes round trip for which I only got paid for 20.

1558731796,Lyft,"TL;DR: Lyft listed an incorrect address for my hotel that resulted in me being dropped off in an unknown location in an unfamiliar city, forcing me to wait and pay for another Lyft.

I’m visiting Portland for the first time and needed a ride to meet my friend at The Duniway, a hotel. As I typed in “Duniway Hotel” into the Lyft app, a list of options appeared. At the top of the list was a location labeled “Duniway Hilton Hotel.” I selected this option, as Lyft listed it at the top of the suggested places, and I was on my way.

I arrived half an hour later, exited the vehicle, and tipped my driver $5. Then, I looked around and realized I couldn’t find the hotel. I Googled the hotel and found that I was still 15 minutes away. Lyft listed the incorrect address for The Duniway! My friend had to wait another half an hour as I figured out what was going on, and I had to call another Lyft to take me to the correct location.

In short, I paid a bunch of money to be dropped off in an unknown part of an unfamiliar city.

I’ve contacted Lyft three times about this issue. The first response ignored everything I wrote to them, simply saying that I was charged the correct amount and nothing was wrong. The second response told me they use Google Maps, so any incorrect addresses are a) Google’s fault, and b) my fault for not independently verifying the address through a different app. They still, 5 hours later, have not responded to my third message.

But we all have encountered the rude passengers who you just wanna toss out while your still driving, hopefully at the point when your crossing the highest bridge in the city.

However ive been watching some lyft/uber videos on youtube and ive noticed that some drivers have kicked out riders for the dumbest things ever. I understand that a lot of drivers are under stress when it comes to dealing with riders. it almost feels like the drivers are on one side and the passengers another.

Anyways a lot of these videos end with the driver kicking out the rider due to saying something ""rude"" or changing the address or whatever. yeah it would piss me off too. I saw this one video where the driver wouldnt give the rider a ride because she said ""you didnt pick me up at the front door"". Cmon your gonna kick her out because of that. First of all your not making any money. Second of all, it seems very, very petty. I also feel like its a power move, ""Its my car and I make the rules."" Dont be so sensitive, people are assholes, its always been like this no matter where you work. Other times drivers wont stop at the gas station because they dont have time or not covered by insurance. I dont like doing it either, but i usually do it because its really quick and youll usually get a tip out of it. in most cases your avoiding a pointless argument as well.

I said I couldn't wait because it was a one-way Shared ride. She said she didn't have a phone. Someone had requested the ride for her. She said she would pay me in cash when she got home. 

While she was pleading with me to wait, I got another ping and told her I had to go. I figured someone at the school would help her. 

I went and did two short rides, and then picked up a couple of suit &amp; tie gentlemen at a business park.

1558381211,Lyft,"A few days ago I took a lyft ride (XL) from my hotel in Washington DC to White house visitors center which was supposed to be around $10. I was along with five family members who were visiting DC and staying with me at the same hotel. We were dropped off in front of White house visitor center within 20-25 minutes after getting into the car. As I had a two years old son with me and I was to busy taking care of him as well as my parents so could not check my cell phone next few hours. We visited nearby places like white house, war memorial and also took our lunch in an Indian restaurant (where I made payment using credit card). When I took off my mobile from my pocket, I was shocked to see a notification from Lyft, it charged me around $134. I checked the ride description, it mentioned that I changed the destination to my home address in Baltimore and we were dropped of there and also gave tips to driver (which I usually don't do). Immediately, I tried to contact with Lyft via email and they were very reactant in this case. I was not sure what to do and on our way back to Baltimore on May 18th, I spoke with the Lyft driver with whom we are coming back to, he suggested me to call lyft or going to nearby lyft office to report. Immediately I made a call to Lyft and I was assured by customer care officer that he would investigate the case with his team but nothing happened after that. Today on May 20th I called Lyft again, they promised me to investigate this issue. But I am not happy with them how they are handling this case.   
Can you please advise me what should I do now? Shall I contact with Police and report to them? I am suspecting the Lyft driver who has done something very wrong with my account or anything he has done to change my destination after dropping me off.

1558374058,Lyft,"[Pic for proof of the fare.](https://imgur.com/gallery/SF43Gsg)  I feel terrible the tip wasn't larger but I figured it would come out to about 15% after his take and pay for his gas home.  

Let me preface this by saying I'm a part-time driver myself, so I had a general sense of how tough this may be to pull off...  

I am a Business Developer and have clients out on the road to take care of.  Yesterday, my client missed his puddle jumper flight from Minneapolis to a small town in the UP of Michigan.  I HAD to have him there by Monday morning.  So we obviously went the route of a rental car first.  The problem is, he didn't travel with a credit card and they wouldn't take mine over the phone.  I get it, they are attempting to protect themselves but it never worked out, so I had to think of the quickest backup plan.

I decided to see if we can get him a Lyft ride through my own app and discovered it was only about $75 more than what they wanted to charge me for a one way car rental.  Being a driver, I immediately called every driver request I put in.  The first five were nice about it but verbally declined so I cancelled it on them.  In swoops ""L"", I won't give his full name here since I don't know if he wants it out there.  He agrees to the 4+ hour ride as long as I tip.  I also offered for my client to buy him dinner along the way for his troubles.

Well, after four and a half hours or so, because they did stop to eat, my client arrived safely around 9:30 PM local time.  I hope the drive back for L wasn't too terrible and I can't thank him enough for saving our ass that day and taking on what may end up being the longest trip of his rideshare career.  Hoping he maybe picked up another fare or two if that was even possible and got home before 2 AM.

1558321852,Lyft,"Hi, I'm making this post for my father-- who is hard of hearing, which combined with his immigrant status (US citizen, but Pakistani) and poor English skills makes it difficult to communicate or relatable to some riders :(

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

\- He was driving Uber for three months (it's been the happiest he's been in a LONG time)

\- He had very high ratings and usually was tipped well and complimented for his driving 

\- Out of the blue he received two reports for unsafe driving (which were false, he's almost *too* safe of a driver)

\- We went through his log of rides and he can't recall anytime he was unsafe, speeding, or disrespectful

\- Account deactivated, we tried to fight it but Uber policy is total bull. He's been very depressed, so I made a Lyft account for him.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask-- help me help my dad out... what should he do to avoid something similar to his Uber situation? He's very safe and respectful, his car is always clean, and he almost always gets people to their location on time. What are some tips or strategies for him to maintain a good status with Lyft and maintain his account so he can drive..

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate your help and insights, seeing my dad like this very heartbroken... and I just wanna help him do something he loves.

1558246381,Lyft,"A few weeks ago, I flew home to New Orleans from my duty station in Japan. I flew through LA and had a couple hours there and my girlfriend and I were able to meet up before flying to our final destination together. This was roughly a 30 hour trip for me, so you can imagine I was a little out of it by the time we finally got in to New Orleans.

&amp;#x200B;

We called a Lyft on my girlfriend's phone from the airport to my friend's house where we were staying. After getting our bags out of the car and onto the porch, our driver began to drive away when I realized I had left my backpack (with my passport, laptop and military orders) and phone in the back seat. I managed to run to an adjacent road that he had to drive on to get out of the neighborhood and tried to wave him down, but he seemingly didn't see me or just didn't care.

&amp;#x200B;

We tried several times to contact him through the app but to no avail. We also sent an email to Lyft support almost immediately. We had two weeks in New Orleans so I was almost certain I'd get my things back.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few days of correspondence, Lyft confirmed that the driver had our stuff and would be dropping it off to us, but didn't give us a way to contact him (understandable that they don't want to give out info) so it was a waiting game for us. 

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't hear from the driver at all. We reached out to Lyft multiple times but they began to ignore our emails or send back generic responses, seemingly pawning us off to other service representatives in the process. After a week of no results, we decided to contact NOPD and give them all of the info we had on the driver, which was quite enough if we're being honest because we talked a bit during the ride.

&amp;#x200B;

We still have yet to hear back from NOPD or Lyft regarding my items, and this all occurred several weeks ago, so I'm wondering what you think we should do now. What was originally a mistake on my part has at this point turned into a theft on the driver's part. Open to any suggestions or guidance.

After going back and forth with the guy at the hub, and showing him email chains with support where nothing ever gets resolved, he told me that I shouldn't be ""arguing balls and strikes"".   


I asked  him what he meant by that, and he said when a baseball manager argues balls and strikes, he gets kicked out of the game. He wasn't rude in the way he said it, but my questions were not answered, and I didn't press the issue because it was Friday afternoon and they were ready to close the office, so I just left.

Background checks, licensing and insurance could be verified through a third party service that would be paid for by the rider and valid for a specific time (and renewed every 6 months or so).

1555636406,Lyft,"Several riders have mentioned the free upgrade Lyft gave them.  I didn't understand or pay attention to what they were talking about, but today I got to see it directly from a passenger's phone.   


I drive a new GMC Acadia, which qualifies for XL and LUX, but during the week I take regular Lyft trips to stay busier. Lyft is sending these regular Lyft passengers a message saying ""Enjoy a free upgrade to Luxury on us"".  


This bothers me because the upgrade is really on ME. I'm the one paying $4 a gallon for gas and keeping the car spotless in case I get an actual LUX ride. If Lyft wants to take the credit for giving free upgrades, they should be paying me the LUX rate for these trips.   


Also, a few weeks ago I took some Shared trips and discovered that Lyft just keep piling on Shared passengers until the SUV is full. They do not stop at 4 passengers. They will go all the way to 6 and literally treat you like a city bus.   


Taking 6 people on an XL trip is not a problem because they all get in and out at the same time, but on Shared it becomes a logistical nightmare. This led me to stop taking Shared rides, and the ""upgrade to Luxury"" message is making me question regular Lyft rides as well.

Within three minutes, he's bragging about once being a cocaine dealer making fifteen thousand dollars a week. ""What made you stop?"" ""Prison. But I didn't go in for that; They got me for shooting at someone.""

So I'm pretty much done talking at this point. ""What do you listen to? I've got my classic rock playlist rolling, if that's cool."" It had been muted for a while, so I turned it up and landed on Queen. Fuck. This man does not strike me as a fan of Queen. 

And he's not. He asks if I heard of Seether, which I had not, so I let the Nazi type it into my Spotify. I was surprised that it wasn't total garbage but didn't even care, since whatever the fuck he made come from my speakers was sure to be easier to listen to than the garbage coming from his mouth. Seether sounds like a Stone Temple Pilots cover band but with original songs. 

After what seemed like seventen years, we finally made it to this seedy hotel in Norcross and he wanted to shake my hand. OK, I guess we're doing this.

I became completely disgusted with my ex-boyfriend to the point where I just couldn't stand him and welcomed the breakup with open arms; however, I'm having trouble with it. The backstory to how this came to be:

Ex-boyfriend is 29. He drives for Lyft full-time. At first, I thought it would be temporary but after five months of dating he wasn't striving to do anything more than that. I talked to him about new job opportunities, offered to help him with his resume, he said didn't like school but I still offered to help pay for a two-year degree so he would at least invest in a trade; however, nothing sticked. No ambition whatsoever. He lives with his mom who enables him. In fact, because his father is wealthy he feels somewhat entitled to his father's money. He would whine and complain about how his father wouldn't ""help"" him but he wouldn't do anything in return to change his future. This led me to be completely turned off by him. I would only see him once or twice a week. It was the same routine every weekend. I would have to drive to go see him, have sex, go have lunch/dinner, go back to his house to watch Netflix. All week leading up to seeing each other all he talked/joked about was sex by the time I saw him I was already sexed out. I eventually started to have no desire for him. I also didn't enjoy his work environment. All he drove was drunk women who wanted to sleep with him, strippers and hookers, you name it. He would often call me and tell me about the women that flirted with him, sex positions other women told him to try which I did not appreciate, or the fact that he got excited over driving a pornstar that he had to call and tell me and cut our phone conversation short because he had to tell his best friend about it. At times I felt like the reason he didn't want to find another job was because he enjoyed the validation he was getting from all these random women. I'm not sure if this insecurity stemmed from the fact that he lacks size down there but it certainly led me to believe he would eventually cheat on me.

I had a serious conversation with him about the fact that I wasn't happy anymore. I told him that I wanted to be with a partner that was working towards something. He often talked about getting married and having kids together but I told him that we wouldn't get there if he continued the same path. I'm an accountant, going to school to get my degree, I have money in the bank, I own a house which made me really uneasy about marriage with him. I worked so hard for all these things to eventually give him half of what I own if things went sour. I told him that because he was talking about marriage. I had every right to question him on what his long-term goals were and if we were compatible on our values and beliefs. He became incredibly quiet for the next two weeks and opted to break up with hopes of getting back together in the future after finding his ""passion"".

The reason why I'm having such trouble with this is because I almost feel like I'm abandoning him because I know he struggles with depression or that perhaps I'm being shallow for wanting to be with a partner that's striving to be better every day (..by the way doesn't mean he needs to have all his ducks in a row or that he makes more than me but that he has goals and actively works towards them.)

1552744923,Lyft,"So, I'm in an odd situation where I have been going back and forth in e-mails with Lyft, and the Lyft rep needs to know the username of someone from a ride two days ago. As far as I know there's no other way for me to see the username from a previous ride outside of going to the ride in your history, and attempting to give them a rating.   


The situation is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

I drove about 16 minutes out to pick up a passenger who had an 8.5 minute ride, and I received a ""ride adjustment"" to compensate the distance I drove to pick them up.  


Yesterday, I drove 21 minutes out to pick up a passenger who had a 4.5 minute ride, and I didn't receive any ""ride adjustment"" to compensate the distance at all.  


The Lyft Q&amp;A on the app says that they don't offer any perks to people who drive a long distance to pick up someone with a short ride, but I've received the previous adjustments before, and usually the app would give me a message that says something like ""Thanks for going out of your way to pick up X"" and tell me how much extra I was getting for the long pick-up.  


So, is there some way I can still see the username of the passenger from two days ago?

1552696338,Lyft,"I would like to get some advice on what my next course of action should be, whether it be a BBB complaint or a chargeback. 

&amp;#x200B;

I arrived at Tampa Airport after a long day of travel, and a long week away from home. I really really just wanted to get home.  Important Note: I had a carry-on, lunch box (personal Item), and one checked ""box"" which was pretty large and weighed 50lbs.  Becuase I had this box, I wasn't able to use the restroom in the airport.  Contributing to me just really really wanted to get home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I got my luggage, I requested a lyft ride, a Driver (Driver A) confirmed, and the map came up, showing he was 10 minutes away.  I moved to the curb area with my luggage and sat on a bench watching the map.   Pretty on time with the 10 minutes, I can see on the map he is coming up the aisle for pick-up, so I move my luggage to the very curb and spot the car and hold my hand up.  He stops 50-100 feet short.  I wave, then look at my phone.  It says the Driver cancelled my ride.  Another passenger gets in his back seat and he drives off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was livid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I schedule another lyft, and a driver confirms (Driver B).  I call this driver, tell him what happened and beg him not to cancel on me.  Driver B was 15 minutes away.  He told me he would definitely pick me up.  Driver B was excellent no complaints. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get home.  I request a call from the lyft app or website or something.   Lyft calls me, tells me to hold. I hold a long time.  Customer Service Rep A (CS A) comes on the line.  I explain the situation. He agrees it's bad, apologizes.  I ask him to be compensated.  He puts me on hold to review some things, comes back on the line and explains that he is looking at my passenger history and ""There isn't a whole lot here"".   (This was my 3rd ride this week (to from airport/hotel/etc)) For that reason he couldn't compensate me. It had maybe been 1 year since my last lyft. 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted I wasn't expecting much, but even if they threw a $5 credit at me, I would expect that the driver would get a ding on his record, or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell CS A that I'm not satisfied with that and would like to speak to his manager.   I spent another long time on hold.   His manager (CS B) basically spends 10-15 minutes on the phone with me telling they won't do anything becuase of 'policy'. 

&amp;#x200B;

He wasn't rude, but literally he didn't care a single ounce about my situation.  I asked to speak to his manager and the basic respond was 'no, email a complaint'.  I asked for an email address and he wouldn't give me one. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, I'm pretty much ticked off enough to charge back all three of my rides this week ($80'ish).   However I really don't want the Drivers who actually gave me a good ride to be somehow punished for the chargeback. These were good guys, honest people just trying to make a living. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it Lyft policy to punish drivers in a charge-back situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, I'm willing to pay the fee and file a complaint with the BBB.  But that will problem get lost somewhere in a pile of paperwork.

Warning:
Long, True, and hilarious (not at the time) post ahead. 
So I finished work a little late today, and knew the next train I would be able to make would get me home after 630. In an effort to get home faster, and spend time with the kids, I checked out Uber and Lyft. Lyft could take me home for $42. Yes, I know that’s insane, but I work in X, and live in Y. It’s a long ride either way. But I wanted to get home.
So this nice older gentleman picks me up. 


We’re chatting, he has his phone in his hand, with the gps going, talking to him. No big deal. He’s asked me where I’m going, and where is Hatboro. No big deal. I open my phone and my laptop and start working. Since I know I’ll be in the car for a minimum of 40 minutes to an hr, I got some time.
He asks me which way he should take to my house.... ok. I tell him whatever way the gps is saying- it’s telling him to go on 76, so he does that. He continues to ask me which way to go, even as the gps in his hand is telling him “make a right” etc.
We’re close to the exit to get on 476.
He asks me which way to go again. No biggie- I look up, and say to take exit GOBBLEDYGOOK. I’ve done this route before, I’m like 20 min from home.
I go back to my work.


I look st the time. It’s now 630. When I should be pulling up to my house.
At this exact moment, my driver says- oh N, what I weird name.
Guys. I live in Z. We’re at N. N!
We’re 30 minutes away from my house now.
Now he’s asking me where to go again. I tell
Him to listen to the gps it’s telling him to get off and get back on.
He gets off the turnpike.
Dead stops 200 feet before the toll booth and says- wait, I need a ticket?
WHAT?
he gets up the the booth and proceeds to ask the person why he now has to pay the full 40$ fee. Which is explained to him 3 times.
He said there was no place to get a ticket.
He says he has no money.
He asked me for money.
He then pays with a credit card.
We get off the turnpike. Ans now it’s telling him to loop and get back on and go the opposite way.
He finally figures this out, and TURNS RIGHT FROM THE LEFT TURNING LANE.
Into... wait for it.
A FUCKING ROYAL FARMS.


He goes to get out- and I start freaking.
I said- where the hell are you going??? I have to get home?
His answer?
Well, I need money since I have to take the turnpike.
This is real like folks.
We get back on the turnpike.
He pulls over onto the shoulder because he can’t figure out if he should be on here. 
This is after the stopping and backing up into a different lane to get the ticket he didn’t get the first go around.
He is now asking me every 5 minutes why he hasn’t seen a sign for Z, while he’s doing 90mph.
We FINALLY get off at the correct exit.
He ASKS THE TOLL BOOTH DRIVER WHERE Y IS ANS HOW TO GET THERE.
I am now hollering from the back
“Take the only road you’re on and then turn right!!!!”
The toll booth guy is just freaked and says “well it’s more or less up and to the right”
We get off the ramp, HE GETS IN THR LEFT HAND LANE.
I am now full hollering in the back about getting in the right (I’m hollering over the god which is still telling him the way to go, this whole time, with a map, in case you forgot).


We are finally 2 blocks from my house which I have given him explicit directions to. I just want to get out of this god damned car. I ask him to pull over at the second stop sign.
He pulls over at the first and says, aren’t you getting out?
Can you please pull over at the second one, like I said?
His parting words as I got out of the car-
All I can say about the missed stop sign is I’m sorry.
How is this my life???

1552553816,Lyft,"I started using Uber about 3 years ago back in 2016. It was super convenient for me because at the time I was living up at college with no car. Easily took over a hundred rides throughout the course of 2 years. Never had any issues with Uber. Then I started hearing all these things about Lyft so I thought I’d download the app and cross compare between Uber to see which prices were cheaper depending on where I was going. 9/10 times it was Lyft that ended up being cheaper. Never had a problem with Lyft until around a few months ago. Ordered a Lyft (a relatively short ride, about 10 mins total). When it got to be a few blocks away the countdown started ticking that we had to be in the car. It was still a decent distance away, even if we could walk the distance it would be impossible to make it in that time. Called the driver multiple times, didn’t answer. Eventually hit with the no show fee. Great. This similar situation has happened multiple times. Then last week I had the pleasure of having someone else “steal my ride”. Long story short, ordered an Lyft. Said the guy was 4 minutes away. When he was 2 minutes away the clock started clicking that we’re departing soon. Called him, no answer. He then starts going away from our location. I thought maybe he was turning around and the GPS kept rerouting him. After rerouting 4 times I was figured he wasn’t showing up. Then all the sudden it changes to the screen to tip/rate my driver as if I’m taking a ride. He ended up picking someone else up like a mile away from when he was supposed to pick me up. I contacted Lyft right away (customer service sucks it’s all through email with is frustrating, but they are fast I’ll give them that). Ended up refunding me the money. But still. I don’t understand why I keep having these issues with Lyft. I deleted the app and will only stick with Uber because I feel that even if I have to pay extra for Uber, the service is worth it.

1552339087,Lyft,"After a nice little trip to Miami for 4 nights, my fiance and I grabbed a Lyft, headed home from Hartsfield International airport, Atl. On 75 North, our driver was not paying attention and ended up crashing into the stopped cars in front of us going about 35mph. All parties are ok, no injuries whatsoever. My unhappiness really comes from what happened when talking to Lyft about it. We immediately reported the accident on the app and got a phone call within seconds. The girl on the line only wanted a detailed crash report, basically exactly like you would give to the police. We tried to tell her we would be happy to do that, but are in a rush to get home so we would need another ride ASAP, but could give a report after. She told us they are unable to send a Lyft to our location (because we were in between exits) so we would need to walk or get a ride to the nearest exit. Knowing neither of us were injured, we decided to walk the half mile, in rush hour, on the side of one of Georgia's most busy roads. We ended up getting another ride, and are currently on our way home. Id really like to have a chat with someone at Lyft to discuss the way this situation was handled. Our driver was very curteous and made sure we were ok, but Lyft made us feel like pieces of meat. They had no concern for us, but were only concerned to get every bit of info pertaining to the accident.

1552232452,Lyft,"So some backstory to this. I gave my room mate my card info a few months back so he could get home from his boyfriend's house. He told me he deleted it, but this morning I checked the payment history on my card and I saw a charge from Lyft. Personally I do not use the app at all, and knowing my room mate uses it to get to or from work depending on whether or not I can pick him up I asked him if he actually deleted my information from the app. He checked his ride history and found the ride in question, which was 2 days ago, and he told me that the payment he chose was declined so it chose a card that was previously used to make the payment instead? I'm calling bullshit and just want to see if this is something that Lyft can do, charge cards that have been deleted as a payment method. Any input is appreciated.

1552226367,Lyft,"There’s an investor on the fence about investing a modest amount of money for me to start a company similar to Uber/UberEats. I have talked to small businesses and corporate and they are all willing to ditch Uber and similar platforms like Grubhub. 

I am planning on starving both companies of drivers by paying 2-3x more on a per ride basis while getting rid of most thrills like discounts. The biggest issue is I need to know the fastest and cheapest way to tell other drivers and have them sign up for no sign on bonus (I’m not made of billions of investor money here).

Ultimately I think drivers are the most important part of the puzzle yet customers are greasy as God’s. If I own a monopoly on drivers, my theory is I can jack up rates and customers will have no choice. If I pay drivers more, they will be more loyal to me and won’t ditch me even if Uber and Lyft increase prices, because they know those companies don’t care about them. The plan is to raise $5 million for a SuperBowl commercial to hook drivers and tell riders come tomorrow morning, all the rideshare drivers are moving over to this app so if you want a ride, you need to download this app. The commercial would also call for drivers to delete both Uber and Lyft from their phones. This will draw free press. It’s crucial that a significant amount of drivers switch at the same time otherwise I will run out of money. This company in a way will be the drivers union, guarding against predatory actions. If I can hold a monopoly on drivers, I then theoretically can starve the others into deep loses. Lyft should fall first since it has basically no other revenue stream and relies entirely on the US market. Uber will have enough cash on hand to hold out but as long as drivers don’t defect, they will fall a year or two later. Uber may in a last gulp of air, throw all its money into autonomous cars. 

This company will be lean, no expensive self driving car research, no ridiculous executive compensation. The bulk of money will go towards operations and support.

What would it take for you to personally ditch both Uber/Lyft/Via/DoorDash/Instacart for a completely new company?

Rating system overhaul
No more 1-5 rating. Instead passengers will be presented a pass fail option. Each yes, will count as a single point, whereas each no is a negative point to form the drivers rating. 
Did the driver complete the ride? Yes or no?
Was the car clean? Yes or no?
Do you want this driver in the future? Yes or no?
Etc etc

Welcome back surge! 
We believe in surge pricing. You can set filters as to which requests to automatically accept or decline based on surge percentage. If you set your rates to high compared to other drivers, you’ll see less action. If your rates are high but your the nearest driver, rider may opt to pay it.

Long pickups
Riders in remote areas or in places with less drivers can agree to pay a flat rate to attract drivers to their location as an additional incentive. For example, if the nearest driver is 30 minutes away, we will recommend the rider offer $15 as an incentive for nearby drivers to agree to pick up their request. If no one agrees, the rider can choose to up the amount until equilibrium is reached. 



Delivery rates for drivers
2 hour shift: $50 - $75
4 hour shift: $115 - $165
Per delivery: $1.99 - $14.99
Shifts are sent out on a who can tap and accept them first basis.

1552224694,Lyft,"I picked up a passenger from airport and went through EZ-PASS lane because thats where app guided me to. When I received the a ticket via mail, I paid the fee and then submitted the receipt to Lyft. This is what they said:

I do apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Right now, I am following up on your feedback about this toll.

I appreciate you providing us with this review about this toll, however, after having looked into your account, I was not able to locate any ride given on Mar 8. 2019 around 10 AM.

Please, keep in mind that the tolls incurred during the active rides (between the pickup and drop-off locations) should be paid by the drivers and later Lyft reimburses the paid amount based on the electronic toll collection system price.

This is normally less expensive than the cash price and other payment options (such as cash, by mail, by plate, etc).

It's recommendable to pay tolls with an in-state electronic toll collection system, like FasTrak, TollTag, or EZ-Tag, because it will ensure that you're not paying additional money for tolls and then get reimbursed the correct amount.

These systems give your passengers a smooth, fast experience when going through tolls. They're also the safer option, as you won't be required to carry cash.

That being said, the only amount we could be able to reimburse you for these tolls is the one paid with tag/transponder.

Observe that some roadways have optional express or HOV Lanes, which charge a fee for their use. Lyft’s toll policy does not reimburse drivers or charge passengers for using these lanes.

When on a ride with a passenger, you will want to use the lanes where an additional toll is not required.

If a passenger request for you to drive in the Express Lanes, you can kindly let them know the Express Lanes are not included in the Lyft ride.

For more information about Lyft's toll policy, please visit the article on our Help Center at How tolls work for drivers.

Since we're unable to reimburse for any penalty toll fees, in the case that you get a ticket, it is highly advisable reaching out to the toll authority directly to see if they can offer any help.

thank you for your understanding and your commitment to the Lyft community. Don't hesitate to email us, if you need further assistance.

Of course, it's not without it's fair share of headaches, slow days, and crazy passengers, but all in all it's been a good experience. I've enjoyed driving so much, in fact, that I decided to do my thesis project for college on rideshare companies and driver communities in particular.

A HUGE part of this project is research, and as part of that research, I've put together a short survey, and I would be so grateful to ANY DRIVERS out there from this group who could take the time to complete it. The survey should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, and any answers given will remain completely anonymous and confidential. Lastly, one lucky participant will win a $25 gas card!

My goal is never to spam anyone in this group, but, rather, to get input from all of you so that I can learn more about what you love about driving, what you wish was different, what matters most to you and what keeps you coming back to Lyft and others. Ultimately, my goal is to use this research and findings to hopefully make all of our lives better as drivers.

Thank you all so much for your time. Safe Driving

1549268991,Lyft,"I'll be done with Lyft soon. Started with them about two years ago. I'm glad to be going. 
As a driver I had my complaints but still went out there. Lyft didn't respond or resolve some very important issues. Still went out there. Lyft screws their drivers royally and they'll still go out there. Sad part is it's an app.
I look at all the complaints on this subreddit. All the advice. All the issues with Lyft that take too long to resolve and don't get resolved. Again... it's an app.
Thing about it is the app does not work without you. You don't have to call anyone. You don't have to send emails or wait on hold for a representative. All you have to do is decide to collectively turn off the app. Lyft does not work without drivers no matter how many passengers they have. You can do it wherever you are. No need to gather for protest. As you read this the power is literally right in your hands. Even easier than flipping a switch. 
You may not notice this but we've entered a time where we have submitted to technology. In all actuality the ""robots"" have already won. And they only won because you refused to turn them off. Not even for an hour. 
Good luck to all of you out there. I'm done with my experience with app automation. In my studied opinion it has done more bad than good and will get worse. Sad part is, most people won't notice until it's to late. And it's almost too late. 
Remember this though. When you want to reach a person through the app. COLLECTIVELY turn it off and they'll come to you. It only works because you turned it on. I promise.",Complaining Lyft Drivers
1549262069,Lyft,"Hear me out, and this is mostly to just stimulate discussion because I’ve heard several solid points defending both arguments. I stand by my theory that Lyft doesn’t pay for wait time, here’s why....

If you wait for a passenger for a full 5 minutes, call them as the system prompts, and are given the go-ahead for the  “passenger no-show” $5 fee applied option, obviously you select that and get paid. 

On one occasion, I had a passenger call me and kindly state that they miscalculated their clocking out time at work, their boss was having them finish up a task, and told me to do what I need to do and go ahead and charge the $5. It wasn’t a massive inconvenience for me to have spent that 5 minutes there and the follow up phone call was super genuine so I selected the “Passenger said to cancel” options. It was a busy night and I sympathized with the dude who was being kept late by his boss. 

No $5 fee applied. 

I feel like this is a pivotal point in the argument. 
Same process; 5 minute wait....follow up phone call. No compensation for waiting simply because you selected “passenger said to cancel”. 

If Lyft is in fact paying drivers to wait...shouldn’t that mean that I would be compensated for that time? Maybe not the full $5 (although it shouldn’t make a difference) but at least whatever this mysterious “wait time is included in your fair” amount???

1549255517,Lyft,"I took a Lyft yesterday, and today morning I received a $100 charge for damage caused to the vehicle. I had caused absolutely no such damage.
The email from Lyft had some pictures attached that were taken at 2321-2325 hrs, showing some yellow stuff (puke/crap) on a backseat. I was in the front seat next to the driver, and I had been dropped off at 2214. There was plenty of time for someone else to have caused this damage. There was a drunk person in the backseat who was picked up during my ride and was still in the car when I was dropped off. I'm not saying that person did it, but even a dumb person can see that there is a higher chance of her doing it than me. I don't get why the driver chose me as a scapegoat.
I tried explaining to Lyft it was impossible for me to have done that, but they just gave a token reply and ignored my next email.

I spoke with driver support and was guaranteed to receive the bonus for several reasons, but most notably the first ride request I received on Sunday cancelled because it took me longer to get to the passenger the estimated. The exit I was supposed to take was closed, so I was forced to go to the next exit. By the time I got turned around, the ride was cancelled.  

I also sat in the airport que for way to long on Monday morning becasue I received a text from Lyft saying to leave the staging area and that I would get a Lyft request on the way.

I finally got her over to the car talk to her try to figure out what was going on all she could tell me where she been in some party, seemed mostly cognizant. 
I took her to her car by the apps GPS, said goodnight, ended the ride. it was raining she waves I drive away I pick up the next customer who's another girl in her pajamas in the rain and young. And as I'm driving that girl home the other girl calls me through the service and says she left her key fob in my car. 
So the girl in the pajamas basically had her ride charged to drive back to drop the other girls key off to her hand, and now that girl is Happy. But she didn't care about the girl in pajamas losing a half an hour, me losing a couple rides or that girl getting charged.
 I didn't know what to do, if I ended the pajama girls ride she'd be stuck out in the rain but she wouldn't be charged. 
If I kept her in the car her ride paid for the return of the other girls key fob, the girl that was half naked wearing leather hot pants in 40 degrees in the rain had to get that key. Two women both barely dressed in freezing cold, meanwhile every two seconds I'm getting a a ride added to me because the second girl decided to take the cheap way of going home and I'm not even sure whether I wanted to put any pool Riders from bus stops in downtown into the car with a girl in the pajamas.

NYE 18 hour workday for me. 3pm-12am doing food deliveries and then 12am-9am doing Lyft. I was prepared for the long day and was totally fine until my last couple of rides, when I realized exhaustion had kicked in and it was time to call it a day.

My last passenger and I chatted briefly about how long I had been working, and I told him I was super tired and going home after. I collected the $3 fare and turned off the app to drive home. As I'm nearing my home, I hear a beeping and find that passenger's phone. Normally I'd try to get it back to them ASAP but just didn't have the energy to drive back to their house and back home, even though it'd only take about 15 minutes.

I turned the phone off and went home and filed a lost item report with Lyft. Told them to tell the passenger I was VERY SORRY for not being able to get the phone back ASAP but they knew I had a long day and I hoped they'd understand. In the section that asks if the customer can contact me, I put in all caps ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL CALL THEM WHEN I WAKE UP AFTER A VERY LONG DAY!

This part is still under investigation by Lyft, but someone at Lyft gave the passenger my phone number. The passenger then blew up my phone with calls and texts while I was trying to sleep. I finally gave up on a full nights sleep and texted the passenger back that this was unacceptable behavior and I would simply turn over the phone to the local authorities. It was then that they offered me $50 to get the phone back. Funny how they didn't offer any reward prior to this point. I told them I'd text back once I fully woke up.

I was pretty annoyed at that point. I couldn't go back to sleep but was super tired, and my chance at working a long New Years Day was shot. I grabbed a coffee and decided to meet up with the passenger to give them their phone. It sucks to lose your phone, I fully realize, so let's do the right thing even though this passenger really ruined my day. I text to make plans to meet at a gas station.

Upon going down to my car, I find a note on my windshield from said passenger. Yes, they somehow used my phone number (that I did not authorize Lyft to give out) to stalk me online and find my home address. This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time the passenger used the Find My Phone feature, which is why I always turn off the passenger's phone before I get home if I know there is a phone left behind. Anyway, I was fucking pissed to find this note. I rolled down my window a tiny crack and took the cash before handing over the phone, no words spoken.

Afterwards, I called Lyft's Trust &amp; Safety team to file a report against the passenger. It took them 3 days to get ahold of me, which I told them was disgusting. If a driver went to a passenger's house, how quickly do you think the driver would be deactivated? Hours, not days. The support rep agreed and didn't argue that fact. Both her and her supervisor assured me the passenger has been deactivated from the platform, and there is an ongoing investigation as to who at Lyft divulged my personal phone number. I have stated that I want this person fired.

I was pretty heated about the whole thing that I was very tempted to dox the passenger as I have their name, address, phone number, and email. I thought it would be pretty great to have all of Reddit emailing this guy telling him what scum he is for stalking a driver. But I've calmed down about it now and am more interested in seeing the idiot at Lyft that gave out my phone number under strict instructions not to see his or her reckoning.

TL;DR - Passenger came to my house to get back his lost phone, he is now no longer a Lyft customer.

P.S. - Before anyone else chimes in, yes I realize how easy it is for this person to start another Lyft account. But I hope it was a pain in the ass for this guy to get a new phone number and another CC # to do so.",I got a passenger deactivated from Lyft

1546834496,Lyft,"I can not believe that Lyft has let something like this happen. 

Last night I took a Lyft ride home from the casino. It was me and 2 other friends. We got into the car and greeted the guy and told him that the ride is not too far, but the freeway would be best way. It was raining heavy when he arrived and I noticed immediately after getting in that his windshield wipers were not working properly and there was a film on his windshield. I could not see out of it very well and I made a comment to him if he could see okay in the rain. He responded with “I’m sober you are drunk, be quiet.” At this point in the night I was sober. 

It put me and my friends off for a few minutes until he got onto the freeway and we started hydroplaning. I told him that I am nervous and that he needed to slow down. Again, he responded with “I am sober you are drunk, be quiet!” At this point my friends spoke up as well and said that he is driving way to fast and that the overpass curve was coming up. For those who live in my area know that this curve is very sharp and even when it’s not raining it, you need to go slower around it. 

The driver would not slow down, and there was nothing we could do because we were on the freeway. I told him once more to slow down and he did so after getting off the freeway. 

When we arrived at my house and my friends go out, I mentioned to him that he should get the windshield wipers looked and and not speed with a full car on the freeway with heavy rains and little visibility. And that I was also sober and I didn’t appreciate his comments to me or my friends. I closed the door and walked to my door. He made some vulgar remark and drove off. 

This morning I wake up to a $50 damages charge. I was shocked and checked my email to see if I got anything from Lyft. It turns out that the driver said that there was urine in the back seat after we got out. I couldn’t believe it. This is a total made up fabrication that really frustrates me. This guy was angry and salty that I told him his driving was unacceptable and that he needed to treat people nicer in the future.

I contacted Lyft and the told me that the driver submitted pictures and said that there was urine in the car and that they charged me $50. They did not once contact me to see if that was true or accurate or get a statement from me. The pictures show some kind of clear liquid that was just drenching the seats in the back going across the whole back. Looks so unbelievably set up, like he put water spill there...

**It seams to me that Lyft will charge a passenger a damage fee based solely on the drivers word. This is a bad practice. This is very frightening because the drivers can make a quick $50 bucks off someone that they don’t like. And there’s nothing the passenger can do about it.

All those people who stiffs rideshare drivers they tip waitress every single time. Every single time man. I know because I worked as waitress for 6 month. It did not matter whether my service was good or I wanted to have conversation with them or I was smiling or not. Sometime I smelled terrible because of working long shift but I have never seen anyone not tip me or my fellow waitresses.     

I used to think they were tipping me because they were grateful for my service and I was thankful for all the tips I got but now I drive lyft so I know better.  I WAS ONLY GETTING TIPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE BALLS TO STIFF Waitresses. They did not tip because they want to they did because they have to. Because it's socially unacceptable to stiff waiter that was the only reason. 

It baffles me how people can tip me every sing time when I was waitress but Now I drive lyft they stiff me most of the time. Only thing I ever did for them as waiterress was simply pick up the food cook made , walk about 15 feet , put it on their table and say ""Enjoy , Let me know if you need something""   .   Now as a Lyft driver I am burning my own gas, putting mileage in my own car,  put those strangers in my car and move them safely to point A to point B.  Thats so much more service I am doing for them.  But yet you stiff me.   Why?  

Because those of you who tip waitress and not drivers are cowards who only tip waitresses not because you wamt to but because you are so scared that I might stop you and say ""why no tips ? Was there anything wrong with my service?""   But because stiffing lyft driver is not as socially unacceptable you stiff me as driver even tho now I am actually doing 10 times more service for you.

1546748644,Lyft,"Hello,

I’m considering signing up for Express Drive, but am hesitant since I’m not sure how much I can drive and spend for a rental car.

Right now I’m working 3–4 nights a week  (10:30pm–7am). I’m living with my parents and share a car with my brother, who is working most days and this week has been using the car at night as well and so he’s paying for my Lyft rides to and from work. 

In February I’ll be taking some college classes as well (signed up for 9 units, though potentially would drop a course if necessary). I live right by the college now, but that may change after this semester.

I’m hoping to move into a place with my SO in May or June, ideally close enough to bike to work, but I’m in San Diego so having a car is almost a necessity.

So I’m trying to figure out how much I would need to drive in order to at least break even with Express Drive. I feel like it would be pretty advantageous to have, but maybe I should wait until summer when I’ll have more time...

Thanks for any help you can provide.",Is Express Drive feasible while working and going to school?

And I've had a serial canceller, as in same name, same location (well off the beaten path), phone always goes straight to a  voicemail box that isn't set up, ands cancels when I get close.

So the last few times this rider has popped up, I've checked the passenger side of the app, and sure enough, another driver pops up (again small town, only like 4 or 5 drivers total).

1546525351,Lyft,"So I used to drive commercially and we had an 11 hour driving limit with 12 hours total for waiting for loading. We were not allowed to drive that long and was always lodging by the 12th hour. When I drive Lyft, its so easy to drive for 14 hours. But I started my first ride at 4 pm in the evening. I turned off my app and turned on destination mode for home. To my surprise I got a ride fairly quick. It was 13 minutes in the opposite of home, but added up to a 45 minute ride. And this was about the right math in my head. I was 30 minutes from home at the point of accepting the ride, plus 13 minutes, give or take in my head I was only a few minutes from home. So I was like heck yea way to end the day. So I get to the pick up and the passenger was a no show. Called a few times because I didn't want an empty ride back. No response. Then I look and see this was no where near my home. So I called lyft to tell them about the glitch. They said some about how it's not always accurate. Then I realize I was not supposed get any rides because it had been 14 hours. She told me I was not on the app for a consecutive 14 hours so I was fine...
This didnt sit well with me because I know if you get pulled over by a trooper or Commercial Enforcement Officer and they asked to see the log, I would be ticketed, and so would the company. I would even been in more trouble. But still all lyft had to say was that as long as our end shows you worked less than 14 hours consecutively, then you are good.

1546462983,Lyft,"Sorry if there are a million posts like this but I could use some input. I’ve been lyfting for a week and there are few issues I’ve been having. 

1. Lyft navigation - this feature really sucks on the driver app. I drive in a lot of different towns/cities and don’t always know the area and Lyft never seems to be 100% accurate with the drop off locations. This has understandably irritated several passengers.

2. Finding longer fares - I really don’t like driving for $15 minutes in traffic to take someone a couple blocks for $3. I’d like to hone on where I’d be more likely to find longer rides and to cut down on the time it takes to get to each passenger.

3. Rating nasty passengers. I’ve done pretty well so far with my rating (4.75 currently), but the reason it’s that low is because I had about 3 passengers one star me I think. The trouble I have with the navigation feature is the main cause of this. I’ve never been given an option to rate people that I drop off.

1546460912,Lyft,"This is a post I've been meaning to make for awhile, and it has boiled over after a week with sparse tips.

I am a very safe, personable 5.0 driver in Los Angeles with 1200+ rides. On average, I will get a tip in 1/6 rides. Some days better or worse than others, obviously. 

I do my best to only pick up passengers with a 4.9/5.0 rating, sometimes a 4.8. 

There is ZERO reason a passenger should have a 4.9 or 5.0 if they are a non-tipper, and yet there are countless ones out there. I understand some may not tip on every ride, or are new passengers, or don't ride Lyft often enough to get their rating dinged more. 

If a passenger was pleasant enough, but does not tip, they get a 4 from me, max. It's just the way it is. Lyft and Uber do not include gratuity in the fare, and have not for years. Non-tippers can mean potentially hundreds in lost revenue in a month. I am doing this for rent, tuition, and the bills, just like a waiter, hairdresser, etc, and anyone else who works for tips.

Help the Lyft platform- stop letting non-tippers get away with this and deduct 1 star or more from them as a warning to the rest of the driver community. ",Help improve the Lyft driver experience- it's time to deduct a star or more for non-tippers if you haven't been already.

Take a lyft there, and the lady hands me a letter with my keys. The letter says the car has been placed on a ""retail hold"" and that I have to return it. My express location was closed at that point. I'm fucked out of new year's fares. So unbelievably fucked. 

I walk to my car and try to unlock it but realize my key fab is for a Chevy, but my car is a Nissan. I go back in and tell her she gave the wrong keys. She says ""oh sorry I've had alot of hertz cars today. You're good to go... James, you had the Chevy, right?""

1546337857,Lyft,,First time seeing Lyft surge this crazy! New Year’s Eve was a bit slow— I started driving around 4pm in Boston until around 11pm when I decided to just go home after dropping off a passenger in a remote tow . Then I took a look at Lyft and Uber and was shocked. The whole metro was red in surge.
1546337416,Lyft,"To all the riders of the group, here’s a few tips to make your journey a little easier, especially when you’re requesting from an airport. To all the drivers in the group, y’all ain’t gonna believe this shit that happened today....

1. If you are traveling with a pet, for God’s sake contact your driver ahead of time. Don’t spring it on us when we pull up, especially if Fluffy *isn’t* a service animal. 

Had a pickup at the airport, and if you couldn’t tell, I pull up and the pax looks at me and says “Hey, you good with dogs?” Is it a service animal? “Umm, no.” Then nope, I’m not. It’s raining out, and Fluffy looks drenched. Sorry, I don’t want my car to smell of wet dog for the rest of the night. 

2. If you are traveling with 3 adults, a baby, 3 large suitcases *and* golf clubs, ORDER AN XL!! And if your driver says things won’t fit, believe us. We’ve been working with our cars for a lot longer than you’ve been riding in our cars. 

Another pickup at the airport. I stop in front of a group of people, right in front of the pax icon. It turns out the pax was about 10 feet in front of me, waving to me to pull up. First strike. I’m not a dog. You have all your crap on a cart, and y’all are standing around, so I know your legs ain’t broke. I pull up, (don’t ask, I don’t know why either), and the first thing I notice is the baby in a chest carrier. I *thought* it would be a car seat cancel, but nope, they have one. I get out and go to the back to start loading. The husband starts securing the car seat while the wife is trying to load the clubs. I take over with the clubs and realize that with the luggage and amount of paxs, either one person is getting left behind, or some luggage is. Everything will not fit. So I break the bad news to them. 

Me - Yeah, look, you have too much luggage here. Y’all need to cancel and order an XL. 

Pax Wife - Oh. 

Pax Husband - No, it’ll fit!

Dude comes over and is ramming the clubs into the car. Yeah, that’ll work. 

Me - Sir, you have too much luggage and people for my car. All will **not** fit. You need to cancel and order an XL. 

PH - Everything fit in other cars. It’ll fit. 

Me - Sir, everything will **not** fit in my car. Please cancel and order an XL. 

PH - It **FIT** in **OTHER** cars!

At this point, dude starts to square off at me. Wife comes up and grabs his shoulder, (I guess this is not some new behavior on him), and starts pulling him back. 

PH - **FINE!! YOU** cancel then! &lt;yanks the clubs out of the car and storms off&gt;

PW - Umm, what about the car seat? It’s still in the car. 

Me - Well you should probably take it out, don’t you think?

I just can’t get over that this douche was 1) trying to intimidate me, and 2) getting ready to fight over this. I really feel sorry for the wife, because it really looked like this was nothing new for her. The look on her face was that of “Shit, not *again*...”

1543851548,Lyft,"Just want to share my story about what happened,  and the insurance process. 

I picked up a pax at a pharmacy. I was on a side street turning left into a 4 lane road with a median in the center to allow you to stop and merge into the left turn lane. As I was stopped in the center, a driver decided at the last minute to turn towards the side street I came out of. He turned left in front of me very tight and side swepped my front end pretty hard. Luckily there were no injuries, the pax was in the front seat and acknowledged it was the other drivers fault and the other driver admitted that. I pulled back into the pharmacy parking lot. Here's what I did next to cover myself on all ends. 

1. I immediately called the police. There were no injuries so standard report call.
2. Exchange information with the other driver.
2. Report the accident to Lyft through the app. It will ask you to take pictures of all 4 corners of the vehicles involved and a statement of what happened. 
3. Call Lyft emergency hotline. They will confirm the information and submit it to York Express,  their insurance company.
4. Give statement to police. The guy changed his story (of course) and said I was moving luckily I have a dashcam that says otherwise.
4. Call your insurance company and hopefully you have rideshare gap insurance (thankfully I had added it 2 weeks ago) 

The damage to my car was mostly on the bumper cover, but can't determine the true extent until a body shop takes a look at it. 

York Express asked me to download an app to take pictures for my claims process. Took more pictures and submitted them. After a few hours,  I got a message for the repairs estimate at 572.00 but they acknowledge there may be more unseen damage and they will work with the body shop for additional charges.  In other words, they will fix the car. Haven't been to a shop yet, but I'll keep updating throughout the process.",Was in an accident yesterday with a Lyft passenger. What happened next..

If I expect to do Lyft less than 30 hours/week, what's better for my wallet? I don't need a new car but it'd be nice for a little upgrade. I was thinking if I'm paying for the rental (because I probably won't reach 75 rides/week) anyways, I might as well pay towards something I'll own.

What's your opinion on the two options and which you think is better if I'm tight on money (down payment to buy a car will have to be low) and won't be doing lyft full time? Also how many hours would you recommend driving to make the rental worth it?

1543692680,Lyft,"Over the last year, I've been using this service nearly everyday for my dad, who is 74 and in a small wheelchair. We have cut down to once or twice a month because it's always a complete nightmare.

It goes like this. First, my dad goes outside - we never order the lyft until he is out and waiting. Then we order the lyft. Then I text the driver ""Hi, your passenger is at X and he's the grey haired gentleman in the black wheelchair."" 

At this point, there is a 50% chance that the driver will cancel on me. OR they won't see the txt message, show up to our residence - see my dad there with his chair - and drive on. At this point, they send us a cancellation or very often a ""no show"" fee which is just icing on the insult cake and a lie because I never even order the lyft until he is already outside waiting at the front door to avoid this exact situation. I have to keep reordering the lyft until we find someone that will take him. Often 2 or 3 drivers will cancel in this way until we find someone. 

Their policy is that foldable chairs can be accommodated. But it feels like drivers either aren't aware of this or simply don't care, or perhaps don't want to be bothered with it. 

The times where the drivers have been compassionate and actually gave him the ride are so rare that I can remember each one. I have complained about this TO lyft, and the best they can do is offer a ""$5"" credit. What? At this point, I don't even want the credit because I don't want to use the service, but even if I did - that is just insulting. ""Sorry we discriminated against you for your disability, here's $5!"" 

Is it really so inconvenient to pick up someone in a small wheelchair? Is there anything that I can do differently in the way that I order it, or perhaps I'm texting the wrong things to the driver? I am very specific, tell them what my dad looks like, that he is right out front, and in a foldable wheelchair. Since this usually gets cancellations right off the bat - maybe I shouldn't disclose this? I am just trying to be helpful by letting them know where he is./what he looks like/who they're picking up.

Is there anything I can do differently? Am I in the wrong here and just missing it? The last person I want to be is some haughty ""let me speak to your manager"" demanding, condescending, asshole if I am using the service wrong - I need to know that. Thanks for reading.

1543680113,Lyft,"So we got lyft and uber this summer. I typically just use lyft and I use it often. It's cheaper than a taxi and usually faster. I'm sold!

However, it seems like the app either doesn't actually know where i am or the drivers don't. Seems like it doesn't matter what i do. I've tried pinning locations, letting the app do it, typing in the actual address...I watch the drivers circle around and around. I stood in the pissing rain while the driver just went right past me twice. I called him and i was like ""do you not know where i am?"" Why are you driving in a city if you don't know where anything is or how to get around?

I called rider support and she told me to update my app. No update available. She told me not to pin my location because it's not as accurate? Lady, inaccuracy is me waiting outside my pickup location and watching my Lyft drive past me twice and then call me and tell me they can't find it or they weren't sure it was the right address. I end up having to walk a street over cause they give up and just pull over somewhere. Seems like it's a problem with drivers themselves. I've gotten into the drivers car and the first thing they say is "" im assuming you're not (my name)."" I'm like yeah it's me like im just gonna hop in a strangers car??? Wtf.

What's the deal? Seems like there is always an issue with the app and it seems like the majority of the drivers don't know the town at all. I've had drivers call me a backseat driver for suggesting the fastest route. Like it's cute that you have a basket of candy for your passengers but it would be cuter if you could just pick me up from like...where i am...? It's not some indistinct location. I'm literally standing outside trying my best to look like someone waiting to be picked up. I don't know how to make it easier. 

They gave me a credit and I'm like that's cool but it doesnt change anything. It's flawed because it relies on stupid people to deliver a service and I'm kind of over it but I'll do continue to use it because I'm stupid too.

1543626911,Lyft,"I had a rider (two actually) that I picked up last night, and asked to make a stop. We were busy, and I told him to add it to the route and they beat around the bush, and I was wasting time and potentially missing other rides...

He talked me through the directions, just to get on with the ride and when we were about a block away, my phone rang twice through Lyft, and then he cancelled the ride.

Since he called, and we weren't on his ""planned route"" he just said I didn't show up and cancelled without repercussion.

I called and explained this to the rep, she opened a ticket, linked his account and the ride to my ticket and paid me for the trip and time spent with support.

Since he knew exactly how to try circumventing the repercussions, they think he has done this multiple times. After ""two or three"" times doing this, they will cancel his account. I am not likely to be the first, and hopefully I am the last.

If this happens to you, note the address of where you dropped them off. Pull over and call support immediately. They will be able to see that the ride was requested, that you went to their stated location, picked them up, and when they look in his file, they can see where you both were when he cancelled by cross referencing his cancel location with yours from when he called you. This will put him in your car. This is the proof that he is scamming you.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation here is I live in Southern California and don't own a car. Due to quite a few mistakes I've made in my life, I don't have the means to finance one or buy one outright just yet. So as of now, if I go anywhere or do anything, I bike if it's within a few miles and then I Lyft if it's further (which inevitably turns into paying both ways most of the time). I'm diligently saving to outright buy a car but it's going to take time.  By my calculations and with the money I make, I think I can do it within about 6 months for a decent car. So as it sits right now, I put all that I can away and bike or Lyft when I need. However, I feel like I'm spending tons of money on a weekly basis on Lyft and the like and 90% of the time, I limit myself to a few miles so as to not spend a ton. Basically that means I'm stuck in a 10 mile bubble essentially. Not necessarily a bad thing but I'd like to have the freedom a car can provide.

Here is where Express Drive comes in. My intention is to use the service as a way to rent a car for a temporary fix while being able to drive for Lyft to help offset the cost. I'd be willing to swing whatever hours it took to just offset the cost then stop for that week. I'm not looking to make any extra money on top of covering the rental (unless it turns out to be more lucrative than I thought but I doubt it). So I would essentially use the car for personal use and then as often as I can, I'd drive for Lyft to bring the cost down. Yes I understand I'll have to pay for gas and whatever expenses come with driving and I'm not looking to write off any miles for taxes or anything like that. I just want to do my 20 ride minimum then whatever else I can do in the time I have to help cover the cost. Even if I have to fork over an excess out of pocket here and there for not meeting the goal. I hope that makes sense and please ask whatever questions you need to.

1543172775,Lyft,"I have been working for Lyft for less than a week.  I have fewer than 20 total rides so far.  I have a couple questions:

1. When I go to pick up a rider, sometimes they are not where they app says they are.  I can spot them, especially if they're waving for me.  When I go to pick them up, the app doesn't allow me to accept the ride until I drive (with them in my car) to the spot that the app says they are and then I can accept the ride.  Last night, the guy was in a hurry and was waving for me.  I saw him and picked him up and explained to him that I had to drive to where the app said he was before I could accept the ride.  I drove into the parking lot across the street and then I was able to accept the ride.  Is there a better option here?  I've had this happen several times.
2. Likewise, I've had people that told me to let them out at a certain point.  A couple days ago, I had a guy say that he wanted me to let him out at a Wendy's so he could get food and then he would walk home (which was several blocks away).  I let him out.  The only way I could see to complete the ride was to physically drive to the drop off location and then confirm the drop-off.  This too has happened a couple times.  Is this the correct way to do this, or am I overlooking an option in the app to just complete the ride once the rider is out of my car?
3. Sometimes while driving a rider, I get a pop-up message in the app that says something like ""2 min slower"" or ""4 min slower"".  What does this mean?  Am I going too slow?
4. Last night, I had a lady that at soon as she got in the car, she began crying.  The whole 20 minute trip she was crying and texting and taking a call from a friend.  I didn't know what to say so I just offered her some water, which she declined.  Otherwise, I was silent while she cried the entire time.  It was uncomfortable.  I didn't want to be nosy or make things worse.  As I took the exit from the expressway, she said, ""Dude, I'll take one of those waters now.""  I told her that they were in my trunk and she said not to worry about it.  About two blocks from the drop-off location, she asked me if I was ex-military.  I said no.  She told me she had just broken up with her boyfriend and asked me how I can have all these people in my car with different issues and it not affect me.  I told her that I had been in her shoes and that I know that it's not easy dealing with a breakup.  When I got out, I got a bottle out of my trunk and gave it to her.  I told her I hope that her night gets better and got in my car and left.  I believe that she gave me a really low rating because my score dropped a lot.  If I had asked her about her problems, I could have been told off or that it wasn't my business.  I couldn't have talked to her anyways because she was crying the whole time.

But I honestly do not enjoy driving for them, their customer support can never speak English and there emails make no sense. At least with Lyft their reps can speak Fluent English! How the hell does Uber make 60 Billion and still see the need to outsource customer call centers. 

Last week I had a Uber PAX immediately throw up after I drove 30min in a snow storm to pickup them up.. told them to get out and he cancelled the ride.. I made a report and Uber claimed it didn't happen and I never showed up to his destination based on their system. I told them it did happen and I had proof and they Threatenedate my account for lying. I offered my dash cam and they said they would investigate it internally and I never heard back. 

Today I had a Uber PAX get in and ask if he could drink a beer. I told him sorry no, so he pops it open anyways and then I told him I could stop and let him out so he could call another diver who might let him. He said he didn't open it but then asked to get out. 

I let Uber know, and their lovely driver support emails me 10min later addressing me as the riders name and tells me they will investigate the matter. 2 hours later I get a report of no leg room and my rating drops. They reached out and sided with the customers side of the story. It was the last straw for me. maybe I shouldn't l my ego get in the way, but my rating does bug me.

I don't know how you all do it. Some PAX just suck and there is no way of not feeling cheated after they rate you badly when they are being an ass on Uber.

1542924598,Lyft,"A few days ago, I had a minimum fare ride but Google Map directed me onto the toll road and leave on the next exit. It wasn't a minimum fare anymore and she had to pay toll, usually twice the amount. Worse, I told her that the toll road is not a toll road.  Afterwards, I asked Lyft to refund the tolls and recalculate a fair fare. They did, but out of their  pocket without affecting what I had already earned. I got some encouragements too for my trouble.

We actually gross very roughly one dollar per extra mile. It's not worth it and if you ""rob"" too often, your rating and driver status will be affected. I would say it's easier to get tips than rob. Last night my top town is Downey; 100% tippers with unexpected good tips for even short rides.

First, Google Maps, who also owns Waze and shares data, is optimized for travel time that commuters who drive themselves prefer. I don't usually have the luxury to look at alternative routes. A lot of times I don't even look at the destination and drive away. Very often, it's not legal to park at the pickup point. Even if it's legal, others may rush you away. And even if it's in front of a single family house, the passenger may say let's go this way. Sitting there taking my time is another form of ""robbery"".

Toll road is another alternative route problem. GMaps doesn't indicate that it's toll or not (not that I know of). It depends on people, distance and time, some wants it but others not. It used to need 2 taps to toggle the toll option but now it's complicated.

People just miss turns. Can you accept it? You may use the route everyday but for the driver it may be the 1st in his/her live. Yes, there's no excuse for bad driving but at the end of a 10 hr day, sometimes you lose focus watching for freeway exits all day long.

Lyft says the data speed may affect the GPS and therefore the routing. I don't think the data speed matters that much as I had been data capped to 3G for half of the billing cycle.

The performance of the phone helps you to miss turns. My 2GB RAM phone had been working fine until I had to run so many crabs when driving, like music and trip logs. Sometimes I manage to run two instances of GMaps, one for myself and one for Lyft. It takes a while for them to determine who's the master of the RAMs. Sometimes the phone slow itself down due to overheating; it may be right after a full recharge, at the end of a long day, too many active processes, or just the sun.

Many phones do not have a compass and you hardly need them. If you just move a few yards, the GPS will pick up your direction and navigate from there. So normally I just drive instead of looking at a tiny map. But if I think they know better, like inside a big apartment complex, I will ask which is the best way out. But once I ask a tourist if I should start turning right or left. He freaked out and was afraid that we were lost. Though his companion agreed very much when I explained to them that I just need to move a few yards if they have no idea.

So it's usually going forward, right turn or turning back. If that's not the best opening move, GMaps has the habit of doing a big u-turn around blocks, which is not wasteful but still looks like robbery for locals.

So if you care about the miles, give the directions by all means including ample time for lane changes. And also pick a pickup point that allows safe parking to look for alternative routes.",Why I take the long road

They reactivated my account in the following days but had to deactivate my vehicle from the platform. I understand, no biggie. My fiancé and I had the windshield replaced the next morning and had all of the glass cleaned out from inside and out. Including the A/C system.

We updated them with pictures and they said the hood was still too damaged even after we popped most of the dents out. We mentioned we'd give it another go and have it wrapped in carbon fiber themed vinyl to make the surface seem smoother. They didn't object, just asked we gave them updated pictures once done.

It still wasn't good enough. Now we've gone and ordered a new hood but sadly the paint won't match the original stock color of the car.

Can we really not customize/personalize our vehicles while driving for Lyft? I've seen decal covered cars. Others with dents and such.

1540762698,Lyft,,Pax were feeling tippy this weekend! Halloween is my favorite time of the year.
1540759615,Lyft,"I just wanted to share my recent experience with Lyft. 

My 6 month pregnant wife and I were visiting Portland, Maine for a short weekend trip. On the morning of our hotel check out we were running a bit late for our flight and decided to call a Lyft instead of waiting for the hotel shuttle. 

Our driver arrived about 3 minutes later and we told him we are in a bit of a rush and the airport was only 8 minutes away. The driver said he would try to get to the airport quickly and we were on our way. 

As we were driving out of the hotel lobby area where we were picked up the driver got lost trying to get back on the Main Street and almost drove into the sidewalk. My wife and I both alerted the driver that’s a sidewalk and mentioned the we needed to turnaround and go back the other way.

Once we got on to the Main Street the driver was not speeding and was following behind other vehicles as the road to the airport was all local. We passed a few lights and then the car was driving straight towards the next light to make a left. At this point I was not sure at what speed the car was moving, but assumed we were driving within the local speed limit.

As we got closer to the intersection the light turned green and from what I could sense the driver got into the intersection and started turning the vehicle left without breaking to slow down to make the turn. Also, to point out 
it was raining all morning and the roads were wet. 

Then from what I can remember the car hit the sidewalk and we went over the sidewalk on to the grass area between the airport area metal fence and then slid down and hit the metal fence and came to a stop.

At that point we were all checking to see if everyone was ok and got out of the vehicle. My pregnant wife was on the right passenger side of the vehicle which was against the metal fence so I helped her get out on the left side.

Once we got out two other vehicles nearby stopped and the drivers got out and asked us if we were okay. The Lyft driver explained he was giving us a ride to the airport and mentioned we needed a ride as the vehicle was stuck and was not able to start.

One of the drivers of the vehicles who stopped was so kind and offered to give us a ride to the airport (Thank you so much again if you’re reading this!) and we checked with the Lyft driver make sure he was going to be okay. 

Once we got into the other vehicle, the driver mentioned she saw our Lyft car going fast into the intersection to turn and knew we wouldn’t make the turn and especially when it’s raining the roads are slippery.

Long story short we missed out flight and had to take a local bus to Boston and take another flight. 

My wife called our doctor and will be checking to make sure everything is okay.

I contacted Lyft and let them know of the incident.

My wife and we’re in shock and disarray and in the moment just wanted to get home safely.

I am definitely thinking twice about using Lyft in the future and concerned about their driver screening and safety. Especially with my pregnant wife I would not risk getting into a vehicle where a driver might not be experienced driving in certain weather conditions or what their skills/knowledge of safe driving is considering how easy it is in some states to get a drivers license.

I would hope if you’re traveling and using ride services to maybe take a taxi or ride with someone you trust that knows the local roads and has experience with driving in the local conditions.

Thanks for reading this long post and hope it might helpful for your next vacation.

1540558851,Lyft,"He slides into the backseat of my car. I confirm his destination and begin to pull away. “What brings you to town?” I ask. “Work” comes the quick reply. A wall has already formed in the space of my car. “What kind of work do you do?” I ask, a patient one man demolition crew, seeking to tear down the barriers of defensiveness, brick by brick. 
“I’m in technology/finance/healthcare/sales/consulting/government” he says with a whiff of “you wouldn’t understand” in his voice, as if his time is too valuable to be bothered with exchanging air with the person shuttling him to his much more important Next thing. 

I mentally look in my bag of tools and find the right piece of personal history, the right geopolitical nuance, the perspective that has caught attention in the past and start the work of chipping at the wall of defensiveness. Sometimes it comes crumbling down. And sometimes it threatens an unexpected lashing out, giving whiff of a potential “shut-the-fuck-up” 3-Star or less. 

And if the wall doesn’t budge, we sit in silence he and I. Two humans missing the chance to know each other more. 20, 30, 50 minutes of traffic listening to Spotify or business calls interrupting the silence, or even more hilarious and absurd, hushed private calls as if I can’t hear them. 

It’s as if he doesn’t understand that there is another human being sitting in front of him. Another life that has achieved, succeeded, failed, repeated it all to bring me to the point of sharing my time and my car to safely move him from one point to the other. In the silence, I have parts screaming inside of me saying “motherfucker is this what I served in the military for years for? to be treated like a third class citizen?”. While other parts say “if he only knew the degrees I’ve achieved and the accomplishments I’ve gained”. And then other parts remind me “this gig is a choice, he doesn’t need to know because he’s choosing not to matter”. 

He’s choosing to be one more line in my day, one more Pax for my weekly quota. There was a chance for connection, a chance for us to See each other as two strangers for a bright few moments. But He will not be one of those connections. 

Instead, he is teaching me. He’s teaching me how to sit in patience with entitlement and “otherizing”. He’s teaching me what so many people across the world experience being “put in their place” because of the role they work in. Not because of who they are as a person, but because they’re a rideshare driver, a server, a bartender, a concierge...”the help”. 

He’s teaching me to see his kind for the insecurity they are. Insecure in a job they can’t stand. Insecure in a personal life unfulfilled because of their devotion to their career. Insecure that one day they may lose their job and have to ‘stoop’ to being a rideshare driver themselves to make their lives happen. Walls don’t spring up out of confidence and peace. Thousands of riders before him didn’t have those walls. But he likely doesn’t even see his own walls. He doesn’t understand that it’s laughably simple to see his walls in comparison to all the others who have traveled through this space of my car. 

So I let the man be. I let him have his silent ride, in his “otherness”, his walls of insecurity, fear, condescension, quiet panic for the life of  unknown corporate servitude he’s living. I know this path. I’ve been there myself. And I share his pain silently, thankful for the reminders of a life I’m Choosing not to live. Of a version of me left behind in the dustbin of the past, in search of a more humble and compassionate path to make my way in the world. 

This is not who I Am. This is What I Do. I drive rideshare. Behind the mask of Driver, there is a complete and complex world of human waiting for opportunity. Making opportunity. Finding my way through life like everyone else. 

We arrive at his destination, I smile and genuinely wish him well as I pull his bags out of the trunk. He finally softens and does the same, his last moment of reprieve before he dives into his reason for being in town, likely a contributing brick to his wall. 
I close the ride and move on to the next. Taking each as they come for what they offer. Every day, every ride, keeping my goals in front of me, holding gratitude for the life and the lessons. Thank you. ",The Wall

1540130427,Lyft,"So 2 months ago my friend gave me her referral bonus link. I completed 80% of the application, but because my California license was less than a year old, it asked me to put my old state info. It then made me a MD/DC driver instead of CA. I let it go and never came back to the application. I then found another sign on bonus for even more money ($1200) but it brought me back to my old application. I sent an email to Lyft support with a picture of my CA license saying my location was incorrect and asked about the bonus. They said they changed me to California, but bonuses ""will appear if I'm eligible"". 



Here's a few questions...:

- Right now I'm pending a vehicle inspection and insurance documents so I assume this is why there's no bonus info showing at all? I heard there's a feature that will track my progress towards a goal/bonus which is in the dashboard, but I'm getting access denied error when I try to load it. 

- Is there an expiration date to sign up as driver for a referral bonus to work? I waited 2 months is that a problem?

- If there is a bonus, should it already appear in my account even before I fully complete the application? Or will it only appear after I do the inspection and provide insurance? 

- I feel like with the wrong location issue initially, it probably auto denied my friend referral bonus since it was a bonus to drive in CA not in Maryland, but I got put as a Maryland driver. 

At this point I'm probably not gonna get anything :( what do you think?

So I went the next day after cleaning up some coffee stain in the trunk. The guy who greeted me was at least polite. While I was in the waiting room for a few minutes, I saw one driver finished and the one before me started. Then I waited for an hour for obviously nothing.

I think nobody want to do it. They guy who was his turn was rude. He rushed me and actually said ""Quick, quick, quick..."" to show him my car. But I took the advantage of the situation and kept calm. The check is basically for him to look through the windows and to test all the lights and wipers.

It was reported that you were allegedly on the phone while driving. This is a violation of Lyft's Terms of Service.  
 

As you know, safety is Lyft's highest priority, so we take reports of this nature extremely seriously. Our drivers are also vital to the platform and we'd like to give you the opportunity to respond to these allegations directly.

I live in Maryland which has some pretty stringent cellphone use laws.  I never use my phone while driving a ride on Lyft or Uber.  I have used it when no doing either but always with the hands-free features built into my vehicle.  I am pretty pissed about this whole thing.  I hate people who are stupid but those who lie are the worst.  
\------------------------

Here is my response to Lyft  
  

I am not sure who decided to lie about me being on the phone but at no time during a drive have I ever been on the phone.  The state of Maryland has very specific laws are about cell phone user in vehicles.  My vehicle also has a hands-free feature built into the vehicle but again at no time during any ride have I ever been on the phone.  I find that to be rude and whomever made the statement was doing so falsely.

Preface: Every morning around 6:30am there is a dark pink square in my neighborhood covering several blocks and the corner of the square just seems to touch my car. Around six times now I have tried to drive a few feet to get my car into the pink square and the moment I start driving the pink square moves a few blocks away. Not once have I successfully gotten my car into the square. 

1. Is it possible to drive into one of these? I wondered if the pink area is just one car shy of having enough drivers and as I drive into it there is no longer a disproportionate amount of passengers to drivers.

2. The percentage increase that occasionally shows up at the top of the app (for example, 25%-300%) - do you only get that when you accept a ride from inside a pink square? I couldn't find anything on the Lyft website that clearly explained how these work.

We arrived at thier location no problems until I started rolling.  I had hit the ""arrived at destination"" tab already but was flagged down.  I'm like ""hey what's up?""  One guy left his phone in the floor board.  My Mazda doesn't have the best lighting, so I get my phone that is now looking for rides, and turn on the flashlight.  There was another car behind me of course so I'm searching in a hurry.  My iPhone has the drop up menu on the screen from me turning on my flashlight and I hear the Lyft sound but it hasn't registered yet what is really going on as I search.  We find it and he leaves, then I swipe the app back open and it says I missed one.  My third.  Ride.  Ever.  So the rest of the night I made sure if for some reason drop off is complicated I turn that switch off.  I'm posting this more as mental thing for me.  Like when we were kids and had to write sentences.  ",The lesson I had to learn the hard way last night.
1537640906,Lyft,"So last night I took a Lyft, got out, immediately realized I had left my phone in the car so I contacted Lyft for help. Lyft made me file a lost and found ticket and said they will email the driver about my phone. The next day, I tracked my phone and It gave me an exact address. I went to the address unknowing it was my lyft driver.. I had assumed it was another passenger who may have picked it up. I can see my phone sitting on the passenger seat. I knocked on the door and she asked what I wanted. I explained to her the situation and she refused to speak to me after that. I called Lyft and all they could do is call the driver, but she never picked up. Lyft can't guarantee that the driver will return my phone. I'm very fustrated so they advised me to call the police and report it stolen. Does it really need to get this far? And what will the police do for me?

The car in the lane I was merging into sped up as soon as my indicator started. I had plenty of room to merge, but if I let them pass I would be driving on the shoulder for a bit, so I merged. The car flew up to my bumper and then blared their horn long and loud. The customers had been talking so this drew their attention.

- Sunday morning, I left my phone in a lyft at 3am. Later that sunday I get an email from lyft saying that my driver thinks I left my phone in the car. I gave my friends number for her to contact.
- Monday night, she finally calls saying that she was going to drop it off at my apartment's leasing office during hours or through the night drop box when it was convenient for her. Friend said that she was adamant about dropping it off herself and was not into the idea of meeting up somewhere to exchange. 
- Tuesday morning I check leasing office and its not there. She doesn't pick up calls at all but returns a text at 9pm saying that she was busy all day and was going to stop by later to drop it off.
- Wednesday morning, current, checked the office and its still not there. Not picking up her phone at this time either. 

During all of this I have been in contact with and updating Lyft support and they sent me an email this morning that reads below:

""We've made multiple attempts to contact Norma, but have been unable to elicit a response. It's important to keep in mind that drivers are independent contractors, and are not required to keep in direct contact with us. Since we have exhausted our resources to reach your driver, there will be no further action we can take. That said, please know that we take lost and found situations very seriously, and if we receive any updates regarding your lost phone, you will be the first to know.

Going forward, you're probably wondering what else you can do from your end. One option is reaching out to local authorities. We would be happy to partner with the police should you decide to file a report from your end, and will provide all the information they need as long as they can present a subpoena. It's worth noting that most departments offer the option of filing a report online.""

1534690139,Lyft,"Hello there.

My account put on hold yesterday afternoon. The previous day (Friday) I reported a young lady who called both Uber and Lyft to pick her up in a very remote, narrow alleyway, up the hills of Hollywood. It took me and the Uber driver 15 min to reach her.

Unfortunately for her, we came at the same time to the appointed destination pick up.

I was driving all the time behind the Uber car. As we were going up the hill we met another girl and as soon I slowed down I asked her name if she was the customer who requested the lyft and she said no, ''but the other driver in front asked the same thing, you guys are picking up the same person''

I thought that it might be a multi request for someone else maybe and I had to wait to see what the situation would be.

As soon as we both reached the destination spot and stopped, I saw the young lady who was waiting outside, getting in the car in front of me. As soon as she got in the Uber car, and me trying to figure out who my customer was (cause I didn't have a clue if that young lady I just saw was the one for the ride) she CANCELLED my ride. I received right away the cancellation, there was no signal issues on the spot I was.

I got upset cause I couldn't even rate the customer, for what she did, or get a reimbursement for the gas and time I spent to come for her in such difficult ride.

I drove little further and asked from the Uber driver to pull over a bit and asked her if the passenger's name in her car was the same with the one I supposed to pick up and she confirmed yes. I asked to roll down her (passenger) woindow to ask her what was going on and she did.

I asked the passenger why she called both lyft and uber for her ride and she replied that she cancelled my ride 10 minutes ago which was a lie and false statement. I told her that nope I was following the directions all the time and that the cancellation came when she got in Uber car not before when she was waiting outside. I asked her not to do that again, cause it's nasty, impolite, and disrespectful for the drivers and that it makes us looking like we are ''f\* idiots''

As soon I had the time I wrote my story and complaints to lyft and reported the incident requesting also reimbursement and then I got the next day an email report putting my account on hold. 

Why my account is being on hold for services I never provided? Customer of course didn't report this to lyft cause they can see the footage of the signal of my car and the time she cancelled finding out that the lady was saying lies. 

Also, in case she falsely accuses me for harassment or verbal abuse, how can I defend my self since the incident happened to Uber platform, not lyft's, since she had already cancelled the ride and accepted Uber's? 

In other words I have been put on hold wrongfully, by lyft, regarding a customer of another platform who never received my services, and who could easily spread false accusations in order to get away with it easily.

Passengers rely on drivers to provide a dependable service, and it's important you're there for them. We noticed you've been missing more ride requests than the typical driver. That can create delays for passengers, and leave people with a bad impression of our community.

Our engineers are working hard on improvements to the app to make sure you're getting matched with the most convenient rides for you. It's no problem if you need a break -- remember, you can always log out of driver mode if you're done giving rides.

Thanks for your help maintaining our high quality rides. Remember: Providing 5-star service to passengers gives them another reason to return to Lyft, meaning more requests for you.

1531774137,Lyft,"**Just want to clarify that I know very well that this is due to my carelessness and stupidity.**

**TL;DR:** Left my phone in a rush, Lyft would not provide contact info (understandable), driver tells Lyft he did not find a phone. I call the next day, after getting the contact info after asking Lyft to contact me. Driver says he's not home, doesn't answer follow up text or calls. I wait until next day. Driver says he will meet me in Manhattan, but someone else answers, hangs up and doesn't answer the next call.

Basically, this past Saturday, July 14th, I was in a rush when the driver dropped me off in near K-town (because traffic is always bad there), Manhattan. 3 minutes later, I realized that I did not have my iPhone 7. I then freak out because I can't contact the Lyft driver due to the ride being called on my phone. I did not realize what to do at first so I contacted Lyft via Twitter. Which they responded really quick. At this point it was about 20-30 minutes past being dropped off.  I checked *Find My iPhone* right before contacting Lyft via Twitter and see that my iPhone is in Brooklyn, near Williamsburg. I already tried to get the driver's contact information, but Twitter stopped replying after they said that they could not share the driver's contact information without their consent. They (Lyft) did let me know that they passed my contact information along to the driver. I concluded at that point that was everything I could do at that point. I went home and waited for a call back, hopefully from the driver. I get an email later in the day stating that they driver reached back to Lyft and said he found nothing. 

I went home and waited until the next day, where I hoped the Lyft (automatically sent 24 hours after the ride) would give me a better chance at contacting the driver. I don't know why I assumed that the receipt would give me the driver's number. It just gave me an option to leave my contact information with the driver. After realizing that option is pretty useless, I searched for a way for Lyft to contact me. And after I explained my situation on Sunday evening, she reached out to the driver and gave me the bad news. But I was still hung up on the fact that my *Find My iPhone* location matched where the driver was going. Then the Lyft associate provided me with the driver's contact information. I honestly think if they provided me with this the day that I lost my phone and inquired the driver's phone number, I would have had a better chance at getting my phone back. **I recognize that it is my fault that I didn't resort to this method. I tried initially contacting Lyft's customer service but it automatically hangs up.** 

I then call the driver and we talk and I explain my situation, he responds saying that he's not near his car right now, and I asked him when he would be around. To which he responds at night, so I said okay and I will cover the entire trip + tip that it takes for him to deliver my phone if he finds it. I made sure throughout the conversation to not seem like I am accusing him of stealing my phone or lying to me. I just want to check for myself, because the phone might just be stuck in a crack or under the seat. Since my case matches his exterior color it might be easy to miss. I hang up at around 7 PM Sunday and wait until 9 PM to shoot him a text summarizing our conversation. At around 10:30 PM I call him twice, and he didn't answer so I figured it's late and I will try reaching him in the morning. 

  
Fast word to Today, where I am writing this post, I called at around 10:30 AM, from my coworker's phone, and he picked up. Then I asked if we could meet up for me to check his phone where I will cover all fees for him to come from Jamaica (where he said he was from) or Brooklyn (where he said he was at the time I called him early today \[Sunday\]) to where I am, near 33rd st. He said he will let me know when he comes back to Manhattan and I said okay that sounds great. I then call him at 3:50 PM (an  hour ago) and someone else picks up (a woman) and then I ask for Luis but she hangs up half-way through the conversation. I call again, she denies the call because the call did not ring for more than 2 times.

I am at a lost. What can I do? I've left belongings in Lyft rides before and I just called the Lyft driver while he wasn't even a couple minutes away to return the item to which I compensated for their trip and time.

1531770004,Lyft,"I have a  '10 Subaru Forester. It drinks fuel (\~21mpg overall doing Lyfts, and that's with some highway driving) and hasn't got the lowest cost of ownership.  And, in \~18 months, it's too old for Lyft in most major cities.   


I'm currently in a bit of a financial pickle, but I'm driving my way out of it one pax at a time.  Assuming I can save up some cash and get a loan from the credit union for the rest, buying a second car for Lyft isn't a terrible option.  But which?  


I can get a \~2014 Hyundai Accent with about 80,000 miles for around $6500 if I go to somewhere like LA. That'd get me four more years of Lyft in a reasonably reliable vehicle. A Prius would be more money -  $9,000 easy for a \~'13, and that'd have 120,000+ miles - but they're legendarily reliable and would save me a mint in fuel, especially if it goes back to $4 a gallon.   


I could, potentially, find a Texas Hyundai or Kia with 200,000+ highway miles for cheap. A '12 with 200k probably only has two years until it totally explodes, but I could likely cut out comprehensive insurance and it'd only be good for two years anyway before it's too old.

Instead it seems the lyft gets to collect the simultaneous fares while only paying out one?  Am I wrong to think that $16.66 is kind of low for a 38 minute line sesh?  Granted I only have about 20 rides under my belt so I don't have a good perception yet of the cost of rides... But this just struck me as low.  ",New driver: is this why people hate lines?

I accept and get automated texts telling me this pax is elderly, may have trouble walking, asking me to call because the person cannot text and giving me the gate code(didnt need it, but I appreciate it). So I arrive, call her family member and the pax comes out. She didn't need any assistance and seemed to walk fine.

She approaches my car and gets in the front seat. Generally I prefer people get in the back, and usually they do because I have a roomy backseat. She's carrying a Bible and a binder, and mentions we are going to the church. Then it got sorta awkward.

We exchange greetings, and she asks me how I'm doing.
""Oh, I'm fine."" I reply without thinking.
""Are you sure?"" she asks.
""...yes, I'm okay."" 
""You don't look it. You look sad, like you've been crying.""
""....""
""No.... I'm good"". I tell her, increasingly getting frustrated.

""I can help you"", she says.
 
A long, awkward pause.

""Help me with what?"" I ask, trying not to sound irritated.

Now she pauses. I don't think she expected me to turn her line of questions back on her.

""Just whatever it is you're thinking about."" she replies, ""You can talk to *me*"".

""I appreciate the offer, but I think that I'll be okay."" I answer, really trying to be polite. 

Silence. This was  a 7 minute drive, but it felt like thirty. Neither of us say anything for several minutes, and my emotions are jumping from anger, offense, confusion, embarrassment, and a strange sense of fear. It was small, but something about this person kind of worried me.

 I had put some classical music on before I picked her up, thankfully. She commented on it, saying it was ""beautiful music"". We arrive, and she gets out. I don't say anything. 

""Thank you for being friendly."" She says.

""You're welcome, have a good day.""

I turned my app off, and drove home, not wanting to pick up anyone else that day. I'm confused and annoyed. Is it just that religious people think others want and need their help? Or that I'd open up to her over a 5 minute car ride..? 

Maybe I over reacted, but I just really felt uncomfortable. Her tone was just so like, that of disbelief. Like I was lying.

Anyways I’m bringing this up being I had a real inconsiderate pax and I needed to vent. Most of this will look like rookie mistakes but my point is why do we have to take a defensive approach in the first place? 

I got a ping for a 14 min Lyft. The stop was halfway at a Jamba Juice. I say cool and start the timer when she gets off. I usually would drop off the pax there if they take more than 3 minutes but she came out then and told me they are making her drink and asked me not to leave. I informed her that I’m not being paid and she said yeah you are. ??? I educated her but I wonder if pax really think we do. Then she said I’ll tip.  I even asked before hand cash or “in the app”. She said in the app. (My second mistake is not leaving here). I told her I’ve been stung before like that, do you promise?? With pleading eyes she said yes!  So I wait. 10 minutes goes by. She comes back apologizing. We finish ride. I tell her I’ll 5 Star her. Ofcourse no tip 12+ hours later. She earned that 1 Star

I’m a new driver in the LA market - express drive program, on my third week, 127 total rides - and I’m having a tough time finding a solid earning rhythm here.

1531195327,Lyft,"So this morning I got a text from Lyft with a verification code as if I was trying to sign in. I kinda just ignored it thinking maybe someone typed their own number in incorrectly. Then a couple hours later I was checking my bank account and noticed a charge from Lyft. I was confused so I opened my Lyft app only to find that apparently I’m currently on a ride in Florida. I’m in California. After getting two different charges I contacted customer support and all they did was say they would refund the charges since I claimed I didn’t take the rides. I thought that was the end of it. Well later in the afternoon I get another charge for a canceled ride and again I opened the app and it shows I’m on another ride. At this point I’m extremely pissed because I’m watching someone tale a ride on my dime and there was nothing I could do. I can’t remove my card from the account and I can’t cancel my account. I ended up having to cancel my debit card and delete my Lyft app. My biggest concern and what confuses me the most, is how did someone log into my account on another phone when the verification code was sent to my phone?

1528868601,Lyft,"Okay so I am a new(er) driver 100 rides. I’ve been driving in the Los Angeles Region for the last few months. When I started, Lyft told me that I can only pick up pax in that region (covers like 200+ square miles). 

I moved to the High Desert area (Victorville Region), and asked if that will cancel my Los Angeles area region. They told me that it would. However, I contacted Lyft Support, later to verify that my region changed. They told me that It does not matter what region I am in. I can pick up pax in any part of California.


This goes against what I was told previously. I was initially informed that I can only pick up new ride requests in my own region only. For example, If I had a pax from Los Angeles --&gt; San Fransisco, I would have to get back into the Los Angeles region again before a ride request would come my way.


I am confused to know if I can drive/pick up pax requests through the entire state of CA, or if I would have to go back to my “region” to accept a ride.


I’ve heard different answers from Lyft so I am hoping some of you have an experience with traveling outside of your region and accepting pax ride requests, or if that isn’t a thing.

1528791810,Lyft,"I'm in the SF/Oakland market. On 4/20 lyft announced higer pay for this market and also that the prices in SF would be the same in Oakland. This was previously not the case. Now I'm noticing that although the prices were supposed to match I'm consistently making less  per trip in Oakland as in SF. What first alerted me to this was a Trip i took from SF to Oakland which was less distance than a trip I took and hour later from Oakland to SF that made me less money even though it was a longer ride by almost 3 miles, but shorter time wise by 2 minutes. And no primetime wasn't a factor in either of these two rides.

So I did a little digging and found that the math doesn't add up. And found that to be the case for multiple trips I took in Oakland. 

Time for the proof. 

Here you can see the Rate Card, which shows us how much we make in any given market. 

The Rate Per Mile in SF/OAK is $1.33

The Rate Per Minute in SF/OAK is $0.24

Lyft takes &amp;#37;20 which brings down the rates to $1.064 and $0.192 respectively

Proof here.  [https://imgur.com/a/nNl1f8B](https://imgur.com/a/nNl1f8B)

So for the ride in question it was a Total of 12.53 miles and 20 minutes and I got paid $18.09

Proof Here. [https://imgur.com/a/8FF9F2p](https://imgur.com/a/8FF9F2p)

So to figure out the take home pay we do a little math.

$1.064 (rate per mile) X 12.53 miles = $13.33

$0.192 (rate per minute) X 20 = $3.84

This trip also included a $4 toll so we ad this all up and we get a grand total of.

$21.17

Which mean Lyft underpaid me by over $3 and a whopping &amp;#37;15 less than what I should have made.

But it doesn't end there.

Looking at another trip in oakland we find something similar.

We have a 7.3 mile 14 minute trip for which my take home pay was. $9.18

Same calculations

7.3miles x $1.064 = $7.76

\+

14 minutes x $0.192 =$2.68

=$10.44

This time a difference of &amp;#37;13

And for good measure I checked one more 4.44 miles 8 minutes with a $6.03 payout

4.44miles x $1.064 = 4.72

\+

8 minutes x $0.192 = 1.54

= $6.25

This time 10&amp;#37; but still you get the point.

I also went back and checked a trip originating from oakland on a different date a week before.

10.65 miles and 20 minutes totaling in $18.53 (this one included a 6 dollar toll)

10.65mi x $1.064 =11.33

\+

20 min x $0.192 = 3.84

\+

$6 (toll)

= $21.17

again close to 15&amp;#37; underpayment

I can't find the prices in Oakland before the prices went up on 4/20/18 but I do remember it was about &amp;#37;15 less.

I called Lyft support and unfortunately the woman on the other line wasn't able to fully solve my problem.

When we did the math together she could see what my issue was, but when she used her fare estimator, a tool provided to them by lyft, the price accurately reflected what I was actually paid which tells me this problem seems to be systemic. The issue was escalated so I'm curious to see what is done about it.

What is terribly infuriating is that it really feels like we are being exploited and taken advantage of. Well me at least.

I'm a 10k driver with a rating of 4.9\+ who is thinking about switching and I'll tell you why.

I can't always review my own fares. It's simply not possible.  We as lyft partners rely on them to handle the payment calculations and we pay a steep price for it 20\-25&amp;#37; of our hard earned cash.  I'm hoping this post can generate enough attention so that this problem is actually fixed. I don't just want my money I earned back, I want piece of mind knowing that I'm being paid fairly and accurately. 

I SINCERELY HOPE I'M WRONG AND MAKING SOME SORT OF MISTAKE

I say that only so someone smarter than me can go over this and not just take my word for it because if my calculations are wrong I'd be happy to know lyft is doing ""what I pay them to do"".

1528393884,Lyft,"There was a thread about that a few days ago. The answer is really simple. Being paid $2 for a ride is simply ridiculous. It costs 50 cents in gas just to start my car and drive to you. Plus I have to look and wait for you, and put on an act to hide my bitterness so you won't be offended that I'm acting like what I am, which is a bitter taxi driver (Lyft is a taxi). There is simply no profit on those rides. And it's not that I want to do longer rides either, nor medium. Because they all essentially suck at this point. There are too many drivers. If you take me far from where I live, I'm going to have to wait in my car for an hour and who knows how long it will take me to get another medium-long ride. Since I get less than one ride per hour, I could easily spend that much in gas just hanging out in my car. No, I'm not going to turn off my car, it's 100 degrees and humid. So what am I supposed to do? Too many drivers and pay is too low. If Lyft really allowed me to be my own boss, I would be able to see where people want to go and choose the rides that make sense for me, and if Lyft were really the good company they pretend to be, they would let drivers make at least $7 on every ride. If there is no demand at that price, then so be it, but I that's not true because I check what you all are paying on the short rides and it's usually $5-$7.

I pretty much begged him not to leave me there as I was drunk and upset and scared and trying to call the bf but my phone was dying. I get back in the car and we’re finally on the way to my apartment and this driver decided that I’m too fucked up and GETS ON MY PHONE AND CALLS MY DAD. I literally had just flown back in to Phoenix from Colorado for my dads birthday except that my parents and I hadn’t spoken in two years. Wonderful fucking cap to the weekend. My dad is panicking and wondering wtf is going on and I’m trying to reassure him but he’s getting mad at me and telling me I’m an alcoholic and whatever 🤦🏽‍♀️ just for being drunk...he’s very dramatic. So this douche ass Uber driver is yelling at my dad making him panic and my boyfriend finally shows up, the driver left me on the side of the road on the freeway, my phone died at this point so I walked till I found a gas station and a cop stopped me and asked me wtf was going on and I told him and he got another call and left 🙁 so I kept walking and eventually my bf picked me up and was livid at me and now I’m livid at this driver! I can’t work out any situation where this would have been ok. Even if I were more fucked up than I thought...still not ok. Wtf do I do?!

1525698509,Lyft,"This is literally the most insane thing I have ever heard of in my life. 

I was at Memphis in May Beale Street Music Festival, and while they had a specific location for Lyft pickups, none of the drivers were able to get to that point, nor was the signal sufficient to even put a request in (It literally took me thirty minutes of constant attempts to get it to go through). 

While the signal isn't the fault of Lyft, the ""400% Prime time rate"" message didn't explain shit. My end destination was pre-determined and plugged in, but there's no way to see even an estimate of how much the ride would cost! My ride in was 18.50USD, and that same ride coming back out was 84.50USD. 

THAT IS INSANE! Had I known it would be anywhere near that amount, I would have found any other option. ANY other option. We travelled 15 miles. It is absolute bullshit that you can't find out how much the ride is going to cost until you've reached your destination. That should be something programmed into the app, but I figure that would dissuade people from using the service if they could see straight up an estimate of what the ride would cost.

1525387654,Lyft,"Pardon my language.

Just dealt with the most annoying passenger today. Funny thing is it started fine. I picked her up at the nats stadium and proceeded to take her to Springfield. As we drove it basically took us on 66 west instead of staying on 395. So I asked her if she wanted me to pull over and see if I can see why it took us this way. (I already knew and 66 connects with where they wanted to go it basically avoided the dead end traffic for a quicker route)

So I adjust it and her friend uses waze and I reassure them I dont mind listening to waze if it takes them a more prefer route to get back to the side they want.

They have a few more issues and probably didnt know the area but felt they had a quicker route.

But here comes the issue they ask me to end in front of them to see what the fare came up to which was 66 dollars basically 32+100% surge which a few dollars added for the minutes I spent rerouting for them.

They ask me to call as they plan to not leave unless it was adjusted. So I have to pretend to defend them and give the lyft guy on the phone a hard time all for nothing as it wasnt Lyft's fault. He offered to adjust it to regular price for them but the rider who requested it expected it would show on the phone at the end ride menu which it wouldnt. So she threaten over the phone ON A RECORDED LINE that she would call het bank to cancel the charge (false fraudulent request btw) and the whole time I just want them out. If we were in dc I would be fine but we are in sime butt fuck area of VA I dont know.

Overall these two old white bats shouldnt be on Lyft. I did call lyft back after they left to apologize for them as im sure the call stress the guy out.

I had his car seat with me, and I ran in and out to get him from his classroom. My problem is that the woman who picked me up was very nice, even gave my son a lollipop but her backseat was covered in mysterious stains on the seat, it reeked of cigarette smoke (she had a FULL ashtray in the front), and she had her husband with her in the front seat, something I’m not used to, especially given that I booked for the entire car (4 seats). The whole ride there her husband and her discussed how much they were paying to xyz court, I tried not to eavesdrop but it was hard not so from the backseat. My point is that I don’t want to mess up this woman’s method of income since it sounded as if she was hard up for work.

I don’t want to give a poor rating because she was pleasant and on time but I don’t want to ride in her car ever again given how grimy it was, and having my son in a car that was obviously recently smoked in was just really gross.

1522695015,Lyft,"New Rates for Philadelphia Area Lyft will be as follows: 

$1.27 per mile, 20c per min, $1.38 base fare. 

The kicker is that the ""Service Fee"" for riders is increasing by 30cents. This is ridiculous, and I think Lyft drivers should class action for that to be included in PAY. 

The problem is that Riders are going to Pay More, but Driver's will not see that in their pay. The contract most drivers have with Lyft, is that they get 75 or 80 percent of the ride total, and Lyft gets the rest as a ""service fee"", or commission. 

For Base Fare Rides, the rider will pay upwards of $6.55. Out of that $6.55, the driver should expect almost $5, or $4.91; except they don't get that. Driver's in this case receive $3.38 and if they're an experienced Lyft Driver, $3.60. 

This is a major problem. Lyft Drivers are only receiving 52% of the Fare. That means Lyft is STEALING almost 20% from every base fare.

1522672773,Lyft,"So last night I flew into the Pittsburgh airport returning from a trip and had an unusual problem. I couldn't seem to get a ride on Lyft. I was in the designated area for pickups, and there were a handful of cars available on the map within 5 minute pickup times for me. Whenever I would click request Lyft, it would get stuck cycling over and over between ""contacting nearby drivers, optimizing route, adding finishing touches"" and then would go back to the ""contacting nearby drivers"" message. 

After restarting the app, my phone, and letting it search for 5-10 minutes, I just decided to call an uber instead despite the higher fares. I only live about 10-15 minutes from the airport, so it makes more sense for me to Lyft/uber to the airport rather than pay the ridiculous airport parking fees and have to carry my bags all the way to the terminal. However, my uber driver told me I'd probably never get a Lyft home from the airport because my destination was too close and Lyft airport drivers want longer rides and accepting short rides fucks up their place in the queue or something like that. I was always under the assumption that your destination wasn't visible until the trip was officially started, but maybe I'm mistaken?

I wasn’t going far.  So as we start off on my location driver gets a ride request and turns around to pick someone else up.  (Mind you when I got in his car I was the only one in it.) We get all the way to the where the other requester is and wait 5min.  Drivers phone beeps and says ride cancelled.  No problem it happens.

Anyways, we got out and crossed the road instead of making him drive us back over and he stayed at the corner of the street the entire time we crossed the street and walked up to our hotel.

I read that one might need their respective state's license to be at least a year in age, however, I didn't not see that stated in CA's requirements.

I said yes “I was upset” then he decided to threaten me saying that I he was just going to drop me off and stop my ride ride before my destination just because he “Assumed I was going to give him a bad rating” I told him I wasn’t going to I actually was going to let it go and have a good day today and he insisted to get angry and said “ I called him a jerk which I did not he said well you basically did since you said the driver yesterday didn’t leave you when you let him know you had to rest room so please wait. He went on to complaining why he did what he did and when it comes to customers and being threatened about dropping them off when they need to get to work at random spot where there destination is isn’t okay. It’s very scarey and I understand he has to feed his kids and he said well if I knew you weren’t like how you said you were and not cancel I would of never done it. It’s very hurtful to treat ppl like this. Especially if someone is going through depression or aniexty or has a disability but look normal for a driver to treat someone so poorly. It’s very rude. I truly didn’t want to give him a bad rating I have an extra star for trying to turn it around.

1522444746,Lyft,"I tried using Lyft a little while back and my experience was a giant flaming dumpster fire full of dumpster babies. I created an account, added a payment, and scheduled a ride for 10:15. Then at 10:15 I got a text saying ""Your Lyft request can't be completed because your account has been deactivated. Please contact Support for more details."" So I contacted support and then I get this helpful little email back from Mark. ""Hi there, Thank you for reaching out about this. After investigating the issue with our risk team, I'm unable to re-open your account. Best regards, Mark."" Well thanks a bunch Mark, you've really helped me there. I responded, asking for more information, as he gave none in that short, but sweet email. He then told me that he was legally not allowed to tell me why my account was deactivated. I read  through all the rules and terms of service, but I didn't break a single thing in there. After this, Lyft would no longer respond to my emails.

As I was unable to get a single ride with Lyft, and the whole point of Lyft is getting rides, the only logical conclusion is that Lyft is a horrible service and I will trash their retched service every chance I get. I recommend the the German company, at least they give you rides.

Edit: I just wanted to make clear that I am not mad that my account was disabled, it is just the reprehensible lack of customer service that I loathe. I have never dealt with customer service so foul. Simply responding with ""Hi there, Thank you for reaching out about this. After investigating the issue with our risk team, I'm unable to re-open your account. Best regards, Mark."" is unexceptable.

1522435254,Lyft,Like it hurts me that you aren’t taking free money and you are actively telling people to avoid doing so themselves. I ask every driver I use that has the car to do PDB and the ones that do it make a lot more per hour than the ones that don’t. You make an extra $2 a ride. You’d have to be dumb to think going an extra 5min out of the way for 2-3 rides is not worth an extra $160 in your pocket. You really think you make $640 an hour. Sorry buddy you don’t. You can still cancel 1/10 rides and actually if you use the double tap flip up trick you can bring that down to 1/5. Cancelled rides brings that percentage down even more to like 1/4. You can basically cancel 1 our of every 4 pings you get. Plus there is destination mode if you want to get to a certain place before you accept any rides. If peak hours is your issue you are dumb to not work mostly peak hours anyway. If you do 2.5 rides an hour it ups your income by $5 per hour. ,Why do so few drivers go for PDB even if they have the newer car to do so?

He picked up Passenger 1, then it looks like he had to pick up another passenger before he got to me.  After picking up passenger 2, however, I noticed he skipped over the turn to my location a few times, and was heading to the West side of town (the location of my and Passengers 1 &amp; 2's destination).

Tried to send a text to ask him what was up, and got no response.  Called, straight to VM and the box is full.  At this point it's become apparent he's skipping picking me up and dropping off the other passengers.  25 minutes later, he finally cancels my ride, but by this point I'm already taking public transit.

My question is: how does it benefit the driver to skip a pick up? I'm confused as to why he wouldn't just cancel me, instead of letting this app hold me hostage?

1522332206,Lyft,"Got a promo saying 60 rides in one week is a $585 guaranteed payout in Chicago. Unfortunately, I’m getting a little fed up with Lyft as of late, low payment, multiple line requests (one where it took nearly two hours with like 9 riders in total), and unobtainable pdb if you’re doing Lyft part time. In context, I also started Uber last week (started Lyft winter break, Uber spring break, via summer break? Lol). 

So I decided 585 isn’t a bad deal for one week of work and focused on that for Monday and Tuesday during 8-10 am and 5-10pm and got a grand total of 15 riders.  Got frustrated, opened the Uber app, had a quest of 18 rides with $35 bonus, did 18 rides yesterday working the same hours and got the bonus. I’ve come to the conclusion that you have to run both apps if you want to make money and stick with Uber if you only want to run one app. 

Is it just me or has the quality of Lyft passengers been going downhill (odd question I suppose). For context, had a Lyft passenger who needed to be picked up yesterday from a block over from where I live. She wanted to go to the train station (3 blocks away, I normally walk it (5-8 min walk). So I drive over, wait for 4:45 min, and get greeted by this grumpy woman. The train station is 3 blocks away down the road. I ask her if she’s going to the station and she says yes. I start heading that way and then she starts yelling, what are you doing, you need to make a left here, which i did, then she told me to make a right, go left and eventually dropped her two blocks away from the station and she literally says “finally, what took you so long”. I’m not sure how I could have improved that interaction. I confirmed the destination, knew the route, and was courteous. I one starred her of course, took me 15 min instead of the normal 3, all for $2.25.

Lyft was hammering the text messages hard for St. Patty's Day and they suckered me in with the streak bonuses, $12 for four rides.  I ended up clearing two of them and almost started a third before the two hour window closed (one Line with four different passengers helped a ton).

I arrive at the destination, but its very SF switchback hilly, the pin had her in one area but the address was on the other street right on top of it, due to the hilly roads so close to each other, so I figure drivers probably run into issues with pin locations. So I called to confirm where she was at and she tells me in a rude tone something I've never heard before. "" I never got a confirmation""


WTF?? What do you mean a confirmation. That I've arrived? That you've been assigned to a fare?

"" I never got any confirmation"". 

Can you be specific?? You should get a notification at least that I've arrived.. (Its already been 3 min into my arrive/wait time. She still has time, no risk of no show fee.)

Her husband comes out to greet me and you can get the "" I'm in the mood to complain"" vibe from him.

He tells me the same thing she told me. So I ask him the same thing I ask her. He doesn't know how to answer my question. His wife comes out, and again she tells me she never got any confirmation. Again I don't know what confirmation means, and I've never heard a fare complain about something like that. I told her, well there's still 1:30 on my wait time. So she's fine, there's no issue..

She then tells me, oh no I already ordered an Uber, you guys shoulda sent me a confirmation, I'm done.

I'm like "" Ok so you wanna wait more for your Uber when you can still ride with me with no issue?"" Just as I think that, some compact BMW, compared to my truck, pulls up. She had a ton of luggage and as I drove off I saw them struggle to problem solve how to get it into the Uber..

Getting the vibe she has no clue how to work the lyft app, I let the last 30 seconds run off and get paid. I then report her for her rude behavior and ask to be unmatched..

Do you head home and turn on destination mode or just keep going and drive all the way home at the end of the night? I ended up taking a rider about an hour away (I knew what the trip was and was ok with it. Ended up being a great ride and I got to go somewhere I'd never been before!) and afterwards I just headed home and turned on destination mode but didn't end up getting any passengers the entire way back. Would it have been better for me to stay where I was and just see where it took me throughout the rest of the night?,How does everyone stay near their central hub? If you take a ride far (ish) away do you stay there and wait for another rider or do you start driving back toward your home?

Lyft charged me for some unknown reason over 2 months ago. It used up my paypal money and charged the rest to my debit card. I never took a ride to trigger this payment so I was confused on why I was charged. 

I contacted lyft for weeks and never heard back once. I contacted Paypal and they denied my claim. I contacted paypal again and got my ticket escalated. Now, over two months later, they finally sided with me and I got my $8.52 back to my paypal, but the rest that was charged to my card is still gone. 

Knowing that Lyft can charge whatever they want to you at any time without warning, not have to follow up with you when you ask why, and knowing paypal makes it a huge hassle to get your money back, quickly made me uninstall lyft.

They guys hopped in and I hit pick up and there was no destination selected. I asked “where are you headed”. The requester said the smoke shop right around the corner, (awesome short trip I’m done for the week, my wife needed the car in the morning and I had to get kids ready), and then LA!!!! What!!! Omg San Diego to LA in a Plus I looked up was a $300 fare so $225 for me.

Unfortunately I simply could not spend 4+ more hours out tonight, so I had to tell them I was so sorry and would take them to the smoke shop but could not continue onto LA (as much as I wanted that money!)

Here is the issue: 1) PAX should not be able to request a ride without destination set PERIOD!!! If this were the case it would have said 45 min+ ride and I could have just declined without knowing it was THAT good I was giving up. 2) why can’t we just simply see where the hell they are going before we accept. I mean come on!!!

It looks bad on me and Lyft that this happened, I told them no I couldn’t do it (can’t wait for my 1 Star, thanks Lyft) and secondly it’s dumb for Lyft to allow this to happen. Let someone who knows where the PAX is going accept and pick them up so this shit doesn’t happen and waist driver and PAX time and create uncomfortable situations.

1519351711,Lyft,"I have a premium vehicle which qualifies for ""Premier"" (but it's not black so not Luxe). I pay a huge lease and I have Metromile insurance because I don't drive that much outside of Lyft. Insurance is about 9 cents per mile.

For a 15 mile journey in rush hour traffic in LA (which is almost gridlock the majority of the way and is excruciating) it took about 50 minutes to complete the trip one way.

I made about $24.50 for the journey. I topped my tank off before I left and filled it after to see the REAL fuel cost after the ride. Premium car requires premium gas so it came out to about $13.75 in gas for that trip. Leaving me about $11.25 in profit then wait minus insurance which is about $2.70 leaving me about $8.55 for TWO HOURS Work!!!! (You have to count the drive back home which I don't get paid for)

That $4.25 an hour!!!

Federal min wage is $11.50 in CA. How ca Lyft get away with this?! It's robbery and they should be sued in a class action immediately.

If I drove Premier only I might make a profit but even in LA, if you turn on ""Premier only"" rides YOU GET NO BUSINESS and your just sitting there so you are forced to accept shitty line and regular Lyfts which don't pay shit.

1519081661,Lyft,"Last night I picked up an overly intoxicated pax and the unexpected happened. I arrived at pickup location. Called her on the phone and I spotted her wobbling and slurring to my car. At that point, I wanted to lock my doors instead of unlocking them. Then I proceeded to the  destination nervously wondering if shes going to throw up during the ride. I offered her some water but she said no and said she was okay. I didn't believe her because she was clearly wasted...slurring, snoring, and speaking in tongue if you know what I mean. 

I entered the freeway and as I am driving at highway speeds, my car alarms go off sounding that my passenger door has opened! 

I immediately slow down and pull over to the right shoulder, keep my cool, then I got out, walked over to the other side of the car and closed the door for her. I get back in my car and assured her that everything is good and okay because she was confused as to what just happened. 

Then I drove her home safely. She was happy she recognized her house then kicked the door to get out. I was just happy she got out of my car without throwing up.",One Dangerous Ride Last Night

One pax ordered a Line for a destination 8 miles away through LA traffic, and along the way she was matched with 2 other pax's (including one that had to go another 12 miles, so what should've been a 45-minute ride became an hour and 11 minutes), then those were quickly replaced with other pax's as I was going along until I was glad to be out of Downtown LA where I was less likely to get another Line chain.

I was fine when I started, but halfway through the chain of rides, I had to piss like a racehorse and I was getting cold chills by the time I dropped off the last pax, but I remember the training and quiz emphasizing that if I canceled halfway through, I won't get paid.

However, the help file says that I am able to hit ""last ride"", but doesn't mention what impact I have on my pay. On a similar vein, is there any penalty/hit on the acceptance rating for canceling someone auto-matched for a regular Lyft ride?

1516376783,Lyft,"I had givn a few previous GoGoGrandparent rides (a service that schedules rides for seniors) without incident but my most recent GGG PAX will be my last.

I received a ping to pick up GGG John at a grocery store in the early evening on a Friday night. Cool, lets snag a quick ten bucks before the nighttime rush begins. As I approached I see an older guy with a cane (the GGG text indicated he may have trouble walking) with a full shopping cart of groceries. Being the able-bodied, decent human being who likes to receive tips that I am I offered to help him with his cart and he graciously accepted.

As I'm rolling his cart to my car that is located directly in front of the store entrance, less than a first down away, John asked if he could make a quick stop to an adjacent store and have me pick him up there in five minutes. I said ""sure"", turn my back to him, and load his 10 bags into the trunk. Since I never hit ""pick up"" until the PAX is physically in my car I never started the ride and parked in front of the store John was going into.

Five minutes, no John. I called him. No answer. 7 minutes. Call again, no answer. I would have cancelled and moved on but I had a trunk full of his groceries.

I went into the store and asked the clerk if she had seen a man of his description and she said she had not. I searched the store aisle by aisle and John was nowhere to be found. I called again. No answer. 

My GoGoGrandparent has gone F----NG MISSING!!!

I went back to the grocery store where I picked him up and got the manager involved. I explained the situation to him. Worst case we had a senile senior citizen who somehow wandered off into the mean streets of an uppersuburbian stripmall abyss - at a snails pace with a cane - and we agreed to call the police. By this point it had been nearly 30 minute since I had first encountered John in front of the grocery store. In that timespan I called six times, only reaching his voicemail and tried to contact Lyft support with the title ""HELP EMERGENCY"" and never received a reply.

I unloaded his goods from my trunk into a cart and left it with the store manager and I waited for the police to arrive. Within minutes two cruisers pulled up. As the officers get out of their vehicles, dickhead GGG John surfaces immediately - from the dumpy little dive bar two doors down. He looked like he was proud of his shenanigans but played dumb, claiming he and I had a lack of communication.

The manager and I had a laugh, mostly in relief. The cops weren't nearly as amused. I let John know I was no longer going to be his driver and that he would need to find another ride.

Ultimately, John was the winner - that cunning bastard. He knew exactly what he was doing. He slipped away when I wasn't looking, wasted my time, knew I wouldn't leave with his stuff (possibly because I left him messages all along the way detailing exactly what I was doing) and somehow monitored the situation well enough to materialize exactly when he needed to.

This bonus requires 135 rides and 50 PT rides-- im at 90 rides with 11 PT as of this Thursday night. Having said that, I noticed LYFT was sending me 8+ min away right around PT when it was 400%+. 


HOWEVER, I sat there (dead smack I the middle of it all) as PT went from 0-400% and I didn't get a fucking ride with PT, nearby. Instead I get a request far ass fuck, TWICE! But this keeps happening. This was just tonight. Each time there's PT-- I first get sent out of it until I cancel once/twice and finally get one where I'm at (like when I wait at the train station and it surges cause there's so many people). 


I went from 91% acceptance to 85% cause I refused to literally leave the area where **I am basically guaranteed at least $40 that hour due to PT**-- instead of going to butt fuck no where with no PT and risk getting a 1 mile ride at 2am. Now I'm forced to accept all rides or risk the $320 PDB. 


My theory is that full time drivers get the short end of the stick cause they know we HAVE to eventually accept the rides as they come, or risk losing PDB. Their algorithm thus places Prime Time priority to part-time drivers, who otherwise only drive on weekends b/ PT during closing hours IS the incentive for part time drivers. They keep me working my ass off and Joe gets his 400% PT ride, while I'm left getting the shitty rides that no one wants to accept at 2AM.

     So I gave my first two rides tonight, and they went well. The pax were very nice and seemed to have a good ride. I have a question regarding referrals. 


So I used a persons referral code (for me being a new driver)and it says that Ill get a $350.00 bonus after my first 100 rides are completed.


However, I already have a New Driver referral bonus of $7.00 in my account. I gave 2 rides, so that would be $3.50 per ride. (3.50 per ride * 100 rides = 350 dollars).


I am confused, because I was under the impression that I had to give 100 rides before earning my $350.00. From what it looks like, is that im earning it as I go, getting $3.50 per ride extra.


Is this correct, or can someone explain how it works to me please?

Today I had a pax in the city, who wanted to get out 1 block before her arrival area. I said that was fine and that I'd just end the ride on the app once I got to her destination.

The problem is that the app kept sending me AROUND her destination, in circles and never gave me the option to end the ride. It was like it wanted me to drive into the middle of the office building.

I ended up just cancelling teh ride.

Should I not have let her out early?

I am in need of a 2008 Toyota Camry fitting Rear Bench Seat cover. I have been to 3 different stores, 4 times today. I went to O'Riely Auto Parts to get a seat cover, went home and it did not fit. Next, I went to Autozone, went home and it didn't fit. Then I went to Wal-Mart twice, and neither of those fit. Prices ranged from $30-70.

The thing in common with all 4 rear seat covers (from different brands) that I bought were that they ""FIT MOST CARS AND SUV'S."" I noticed that they were all wayyyyyyy too small...

Does anyone who has an 2008 Toyota Camry know of any good rear seat bench covers that are not too small, too large, and fit just right?

1615875452,uber,"About ½ the posts in the /r/Uber and /r/Lyft subreddits seem to be asking why they can’t find a ride. There are several reasons, all coming together, that results in a general driver shortage right now. These are the factors in no particular order:  
 

1. General bad pay/lack of drivers: Uber and Lyft both have massive turnover rates. People simply do not find it worthwhile even with no other factors. This has been a problem for years and has mostly gotten worst over time. The theory, up until recently, is there was always someone willing to “work for peanuts” but this recent shortage may be cause to reconsider this logic. Earnings can be particularly bad for new drivers who may not know when and where to drive to make decent money and it’s easy to find yourself making below minimum wage or even losing money.  

2. Unemployment: Gig workers can file for unemployment when previously they could not. The only requirement is that they attest that their income has dramatically decreased due to the pandemic. They are currently making whatever the base state unemployment is plus the $300 federal supplement, a lot will see unemployment as more profitable than driving. Considering that there really isn’t a boss to rat out gig workers, like there is for traditional employees, and that they know they will be able to return whenever they want, gig workers are more likely to be hesitant to jump back in unlike traditional employees.

3. Stimulus Checks decrease driver motivation: Some gig workers work only enough to make ends meet.  Rent due tomorrow? Better hop online and pull a 12-hour shift to make the $200 you still need for rent and then do nothing for several weeks. With the $1400 checks, a lot of these just-in-time workers are not feeling the pressure to work.

4. Stimulus checks increase demand: As the name implies, stimulus checks cause people to go more places, order more delivery etc which stimulates the economy. This increases the demand for the services of gig workers while decreasing the supply

5. Health concerns: With the pandemic, Uber/Lyft are one of the most exposed groups. Proper social distancing is impossible and occasionally violent anti-maskers present a danger. As such many choose not to drive including sometimes entire sections like retiree drivers, who are much more likely to die from Covid-19, or part-time drivers, who might be out from their full-time job for several weeks if they catch it.

6. Delivery Jobs: Many Uber/Lyft drivers also do other gigs like UberEATS, DoorDash, or GrubHub. The demand for these services has increased since the pandemic and many drivers opt to do this work instead of risking exposure with PAX rides. 

7. Increasing gas prices: Gas prices have recently started to rise. While a lot of gig workers use an electric or hybrid car, a not-insignificant portion uses older less efficient cars or even something like a pickup truck.

8. Recent media events: You’ve probably seen the recent video of three women harassing and assaulting an Uber driver. There have also been other recent news stories including the driver being killed or carjacked. In general, safety is always a concern as driving is one of the most dangerous tasks to do, even without strangers in your backseat, but there seems to be a recent deluge of occupational hazards and drivers are reassessing if, given everything else, this job is worth the risk.   
 

There are a lot of different problems and no easy solutions. The best thing you can personally do is be on multiple apps, be polite and respectful, wear a mask, work on improving your passenger score, and if possible tip your driver.",8 reasons why you are having trouble finding a ride.

Even though there's no rules against turning the AC unit on in cars (talked to Uber about this), the drivers are using the entire COVID excuse to not turn the AC on during trips. Which is highly weird because you'll catch half of these drivers **not wearing masks** **or following safety protocol at all**, but when you ask them to turn the AC on, they refuse and state COVID as the reason.  
All good though - at times we just let it slide, but on days when it's hotter than satan's balls out here, we just try to convince them, which almost feels like begging at one point, after which we just decide to cancel the ride. But then they start hurling insults at us when we refuse to ride. Like what? You can't have your cake and eat it too? Believe it or not, a month back, one of the drivers even called up folks from around the locality and my friend said that he was apparently trying to rile up the crowd by saying that I was making fun of his religion even though I didn't. It worked though because BOY OH BOY did they looked pissed. lol I don't mean to laugh, I just haven't been in this predicament before and it's funny to me how he played the crowd against me. When I reported the incident to Uber, all I got was the same, ""I'm sorry that you had this experience with us, blah blah, we use a point-based system blah blah..."" and that's it. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if someone was being physically assaulted and Uber was like, ""Kindly share a live image... WORLD STAR WHUT WHUT!!!"".  
Since then I've just been hush everytime an Uber driver pulls the COVID excuse on me regardless of whether he's wearing a mask or not or if he's willing to turn the AC on or not.

Just seems weird though. Why should I use Uber and pay twice the money I could pay a cab driver when I don't even get to avail the full facilities available when booking a ride?  
This has become a growing trend among Uber drivers in Calcutta solely. And the rudeness, insults and curses that follow are righteously disgusting. I tipped one of the drivers this past week because he was cool with us, and he accepted it with a smile while calling me a ""Sala Madarchod"" (translates to ""motherfucker"" I think).

After spending 10 minutes putting an order into the app the app puts up a window your order won’t be fulfilled.  Why can’t the app tell me they won’t complete the order BEFORE I SPEND 10 MINUTES?

Also, it seems a driver agrees to fill an order but has no idea if it will be ready when they arrive or if they will have to wait for it for 10 minutes!  Making a driver sit and wait for 10 minutes seems like it will either severely reduce the drivers ability to earn a fair rate of pay or cause the cost of delivery to go up because customers have to pay drivers to wait!

I have never used Uber before and neither had my mum, so my sister organised one for her through her account. She booked a premium car, from here to the hospital for 6am as she had to be at hospital by 7am, and there were roadworks close to the hospital so we allowed for extra time. 6am came and there was no Uber out the front. I got ready just incase the Uber didn’t show up and I had to drive her there. 6.10 passed, then 6.20. I knew my sister would still be asleep so I sent her a text saying the Uber isn’t here and that I was going to drive her. I got her there right on 7am. When I got home I got a phone call from my sister saying the Uber was displaying as ‘active’, and this was 90mins after they were suppose to show up. They ended up charging my sister $131, even though they didn’t show up on time and obviously didn’t pick anyone up.

I’d like to hire an Uber to take me to the village and drop me off. It will be a long trip, about $100 each way.

When I calculate the price from the formula I get from the app, the price is still off. I tried getting the duration from the uber proposed trip duration (excluding the time to pickup) or google maps ETA. I took the distance from google maps. 

It's just frustrating since given the formulas I see this should be lower priced than it seems to be... has any one else encountered this (or have an explanation?).",Uber Formula doesn't equal proposed price

Uber is not paying me for my recent sick day claims, and I'm assuming I'm not the only one this is happening to, which is why I'm posting this. The system is broken and my claims are not even going through (immediately after submitting my claim, the app shows that it was successfully submitted, but then about five days later it reverts to showing that no claim was submitted). I submitted a claim three separate times this month, and the same thing happened each time.

I contacted Uber about this multiple times but, as always, they are completely unwilling to help. So today I filed a complaint with the Seattle Office of Labor standards. If any other Seattle area drivers have experienced the same thing as I have trying to claim a day of sick time, then I strongly encourage you to also file a complaint with the Office of Labor Standards. They are the office whose responsibility it is to make sure Uber is in compliance with the paid sick time ordinance that was passed into law in Seattle earlier this year. They have a web form where you can submit your complaint here: [https://olsconnect.microsoftcrmportals.com/employee-inquiry](https://olsconnect.microsoftcrmportals.com/employee-inquiry)

Their website says they will respond to your complaint within 3 to 5 business days.

You can also call them at (206) 256-5297 Monday to Friday from 8am to 5pm.

Don't be afraid to make a complaint! The Office of Labor Standards will never ask you any questions about your immigration status or legal work status. They also strictly forbid Uber or any other company from retaliating in any way against workers who file complaints, so you don't have to worry about Uber kicking you off the app or punishing you in any other way.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask in the comments and I will do my best to answer them.",Attention Seattle area drivers! Uber not paying you for claimed sick days? Then please read!

So my job is about 5 miles away so i can’t walk , especially across highway bridges and things. I live in the suburbs unfortunately so everyone has their own car from basically the age of 16 ish or they use their parent’s or a siblings .

I have my permit but my mom has insisted on me getting driving lessons but cancelled them after we got into an argument so I really don’t know how to drive .... and even if so I doubt she would let me use her brand new big van to drive around to work....

She has talked about getting me a car but i still don’t know how to drive yet so it’s practically useless unless I actually have time to practice on it with someone . 

I work at Publix and we get paid every thursday, but i’m honestly getting a little worried after i deduct the cost of my rides to get to work. I’m getting paid well above minimum wage and I do have a lot of opportunity to get raises at my job , but the cost of me getting there everyday is about $9.90 which is most of what i’m making in an hour ......

I mean i guess it’s better to have some money than no money but i’m wondering if i should just start driving .
Although if i beg my mom enough she would probably buy one , i would still be responsible for things like gas , insurance , repairs , etc 

Honestly, what’s the best way to actually save my money in general because i’m kind of lost here 

And the chances of me asking a friend to carpool is little to none , no one around here is loyal enough to be able to bring someone to and from work so i would probably have to pay them more 

I can catch rides from my mom here and there but she’s made it very clear she doesn’t want to always have to get up to come get me or take me to work ....","I’m f/17 with no car, trying to get to work at a 10.50 wage job (above minimum by $3.50) , is an uber a better option for me than paying for my own car ????"

1606243171,uber,"I’ve had it with the crooks at uber. They are the shadiest company in life’s existence and are taking advantage of us drivers more and more daily. It makes me sick to see how much they take from us from each ride and it’s only getting worse. The fact that they think it’s alright to have me drive a pax 47 miles after driving 15 to pick them up, pay tolls of 1.50 each way, and then drive back 60 miles to my starting point and only pay me 29 f***ing dollars literally puts me over the top. And this is just one example of the scam they’re running ... they do this almost if not daily.. it seems the further the ride the less I make. For example I usually earn typically around 1 dollar a mile so like a 8 mile trip usually nets around 6.50-9 dollars if no surge .. and I put that range because literally they never use the same pay structure .. some rides will be .54 a mile some are .63 others .69 .. just whatever the feel like paying for each ride they pay.. there’s no single formula used and when you try to complain to support .. and by support I mean the either robot or 3rd world country idiot who copy and pasted default generic responses that typically don’t even pertain to the matter at hand .. you get absolutely no where except more furious and it takes every shred of self control not to go find these dumb f**ks and take it out on them in real time . Support is an absolute joke and waste of time and you’ll get nothing accomplished I assure you. They’ll reply with the break down of the fare as if you can’t already view that yet provide no answers of why you can literally get paid 9 bucks for a 7 mile trip but 29 for a 47 mile trip with a 60 mile return trip and then they respond with can u provide the date and time of this trip and the passengers name after you’ve literally been arguing about it with another Hodgie on the same message for hours. It makes me want to scream . It’s totally unfair and unjust and unethical how they treat the people who make them their money and something needs to be done .. like now ... I know that if we get enough people to join forces and agree to take action whether it be a strike or a class action suit or something to show were not playing and we want to be compensated better and fairly , and to get a support team who actually knows what they’re doing and are able to actually do what their job entails instead of auto responses and incompetence, that they’ll almost be forced to comply with our demands or risk going completely under...

However, rather than the £9.50 refund coming through, somehow £10.50 was taken away from my bank account? I contacted support saying my £9.50 refund didn't come through, and £10.50 was randomly taken out of my bank account. They said that the £9.50 refund has been applied and will be in my bank in 3-5 working days. They didn't address the £10.50 issue so I messaged again, and they said that the £10.50 is on authorisation hold and won't actually leave my bank account.

Then a full 7 days later, I contact support because the £9.50 refund STILL has not come through and the £10.50 that was on ""authorisation hold"" did in fact LEAVE my bank account and was never returned. Then support messages me saying they ""appreciate the points I've made"" but can't do anything now? Every message I sent after was ignored/closed automatically.

So I opened up a new issue and said that an unauthorised charge has been made. I once again said that a £9.50 refund was supposed to be applied but hasn't, and that an unauthorised £10.50 charge was made on my account that was supposed to never leave my account. I received a reply saying that the £9.50 refund has been processed and to wait another 3-5 working days... The £10.50 authorisation hold issue was once again overlooked.

I messaged again and have no received any reply. This was 2 days ago. Now today I messaged again saying the issue still hasn't been resolved and received no reply.

I initially paid for an order on Nov 10 with PayPal. The app told me the payment failed for some reason. So, I went back and tried paying with my visa, which worked.

A few min later, I get an email notification from PayPal saying I authorized a transaction from Uber Eats. I checked my bank account, and sure enough, both my bank account and my PayPal accounts were charged.

To top it off, I never received the food. The driver took a photo of it in front of some random door that I have never seen before. Definitely not my condo. I contacted Uber support and they refunded me for the charge made to my visa.

However, they refused to acknowledge the charge made to my PayPal account. Every time I provide them proof of the transaction, they close my ticket. They have no phone numbers. I am getting incredibly frustrated and angry that they're acting like this PayPal charge doesn't exist when it is RIGHT THERE.

Today I requested an Uber and it was finishing up a ride and supposed to get to me in 9 minutes. The car just sat and sat at the place that it was supposedly dropping off the other passenger. I messaged the driver to ask if everything was ok. No response. I waited 30 minutes but didn't cancel because I didn't want to get charged and kept hoping Uber would take pity on me and auto-cancel. Never happened. I took a cab to my destination. Meanwhile the Uber app refreshed. Now the driver was at the airport on the other side of town and it estimated it would take him 27 minutes to get to me (same driver this entire time). Meanwhile I'm messaging and calling him and he's not answering. Finally I messaged him one last time after more than an hour and I guess he switched it over to a different driver. I canceled on that guy right away and didn't get charged. .. but like how early could I have canceled without getting charged?

I also have another couple questions. (If it makes a difference, I live in Mexico City.) I feel like lately, every time I order an Uber, instead of a ""fresh"" Uber I typically get one that's finishing up a ride nearby. I end up having to wait around 10 minutes for the Uber to get to me.

You  might ask how do I have enough money for uber but not to enough finance a car? For a car, theres a host of other costs that factor into it. ESPECIALLY at the rate that I would i be able to afford one. 

Again let's just say ""hypothetically"" I need to travel only 3 times a week. The rest is work for home.

&amp;#x200B;

Anytime I have a gripe with Uber about drivers that care less about CO-VID, or being courteous, I am destined to receive at least a few confused people that beg the question ""WhY dont' you just get a car!?! Or why do you ride with a stranger if you care so much about the MaSk...

&amp;#x200B;

bruh. this is a service. its not free...If Uber did not say that the drivers would wear a mask, I would not expect it nor report it. Please help me understand this perspective that seems to think its a) a choice to use uber b) my fault when the driver is reported.",Why do dumb people think that uber is an option?
1603069826,uber,"So it looks like there isn't an ""other"" option, because eventually when I keep clicking ""something else"" it takes me back to the last menu instead of giving me a text field. Unless I'm looking in the wrong place, maybe someone can suggest a category where this would fit!

The thing is, this was *not the driver's fault in any way* - in fact, the driver was a saint and did everything right. Which is probably why.

But what happens is as follows.

So, I was supposed to be at work at 9:30am. I decide to take an Uber since by the time I'm ready I won't make it with public trans. I place my order around 9:08am, it gives me a decent rate, and an ETA of 9:25am. Great so far! Also note that I live in a big city. But it was Sunday morning so traffic is at its scarcest. Even more great!

Now here's the issue - I was waiting a minute or so for it to connect to a nearby driver... and **I believe the app bugged on me, in a really bad way**. When it finally did, it connected me to someone **14 minutes away**. Outside the city even. He basically was able to pick me up not til after what it originally said my ETA would be.

Now, I don't know how exactly the driver assignment system works, and I could have refreshed and cancelled and tried again, but I would have gotten slapped with the cancellation fee. And gambling with the possibility of getting a higher fare than the original. So I just decided to suck it up and think, maybe he is the closest/only one available (which was incredibly unlikely, and I'll get to why in a second) and be late, and look into it later.

Now, when the driver finally picks me up (super chill guy, got me there very fast though I was still very late when the whole reason I ordered was so that I'd be early/on time like it told me it would), he was just as shocked as I was - not only was he that far away, but he was also **NOT EVEN ON THE ROAD. He was at his house when he got the order (though vacuuming the car, so he was at least in it, but still).**

Again, it was a Sunday morning, but I live in a huge city and find it incredibly unlikely there were no other available drivers around. Plus, I think while it was searching, it shows other cars in my neighborhood that were actually close. Even if they were completing trips busy, they probably would have been a hell of a lot faster. I've gotten assigned people who were completing trips. And now with the added fact that it seems like drivers can get orders when they're not even on the road and at their house... there's no way there aren't any that live near my area or at least closer than this guy was.

Now, I have a feeling Uber should be able to see on the record the exact time I placed the order, as well as my exact pickup/dropoff location and destination. In which case they can in turn verify that what I'm saying happened and see for themselves. And seeing as this isn't the driver's fault but a technical bug, I do believe the company should compensate for that.

Like I said, maybe I could have done the cancel-and-refresh and ask about a wrongful cancellation fee, but that's less likely to have worked and they can't really fault me for that. By staying put, I have on the record that the driver assignment system fucked up, and as a result using their services for the purpose of getting somewhere early, ended up making me very late.

Is there a section via the app where I can submit this? And if not, is there a more direct email or other form of contact?

1603063348,uber,"Since COVID, Uber has no longer become possible in a few areas of California besides for those who have significant money to spend. Rides costing $20-30 within a short distance have consistently been $120-210 in range for months now. I've been checking various times of the day, and usually the lowest pricing is a surge of 3-4x. I've been watching surge prices for the past couple of years, and I've witnessed a few 3x at most, usually weekend evenings. But it's never been this insane before.

Due to my being from a third world country, and having to use credit cards from third world banks that have no zip code, I understand at times Uber has issues processing payments from my cards, and as such tend to maintain a balance of UberCash, just in case.

One day while trying to book an Uber, I go an error stating my ""Payment method is invalid"", which was odd, so I tried my UberCash, failed again, which was odd, since my UberCash more than covered the charges for the ride.

I contacted Uber support using the messaging system in the app, there's some back and forth. UberEats comes in and says that my account is disabled due to something along the lines of abuse of reporting food as being undelivered (happened once when the delivery was actually left somewhere else, I'd even checked my neighbours, this was one instance from countless orders).

I tried emailing them, after some back and forth there, they've eventually said ""We’ve reviewed your account and we will be unable to assist with your request at this time."" when i asked them if they could please enable my account.

I even still have $80+ as UberCash in my account, which I can't use. And that doesn't even feel like the worst part. I've always been respectful and polite in my communications with them, and not being able to use Uber is going to seriously result in a lot of trouble for me while travelling.

Immediately after ordering the Uber my phone battery died and I was unable to cancel the ride once I found out I didn't need it. I had assumed the ride would be cancelled and I'd be charged a cancelation fee or something. 

Except the scummy driver never cancelled the ride when he didn't pick me up and on his end acted as if he completed the ride. I never got into the Uber. Never even met the driver because I had already found a way back home. I contacted Ubers USELESS in app customer ""service"" and have been back and forth with them for almost a week. They keep insisting that ""since the ride was consistent with previous rides that they're unable to refund the ride,"" meaning that ONE of the addresses (my home) I've ordered an Uber for in the past and for some reason means I took this ride. 

So I was fraudulently charged $67.23 by this driver and Uber is letting him get away with it all because I was unable to cancel the ride from my end. Is this normal?

IDK if I was overreacting or if my past experiences as a passenger just make me anxious and distrustful of my drivers.

Driver picked me up, asked where I was going - once in a while a driver asks me that and I just repeat the address of the location inputted into the app. Which I did when he asked. He said ok, and I got in. We started driving and He had seen me get in with my laptop and asked if I was going to work and I said oh no, I’m working from home due to the pandemic. He asked what i did. I explained. He did not ask where I worked. I’ve had previous drivers ask me and I just say  I work for a law firm and sometimes they’ll ask for the exact company name which I then say I’m not comfortable saying because I’m not comfortable telling a complete stranger who has my home address to also know the company I work and I’m extremely private. 

This driver tried finding out where I specifically was going I by asking indirectly multiple times which was making me extremely uncomfortable. I was going to my bfs house when he was at work to let his dogs out but I didn’t want to tell him because my bf uses his house as his office/storage for his business. He has a lot of very expensive equipment in storage, he also has a nice small bmw car that’s parked there when he’s at a location working, and he has two dogs (one of which is a breed in my area that people have been known to steal to sell, breed or use for dog fights). That’s his favorite dog and she was rescued from being a backyard breeding dog. 

He’s extremely private as well and has a security system and cameras. So if something suspicious were to happen he would be immediately notified as would I, but I just didn’t want to tell the driver that I was letting his dogs out because he would’ve asked why or assumed my bf wasn’t home and could possibly use that for future reference if he ever planned to do anything bad.

Is a 4.6 rating bad?, and will this affect the quality of drivers I've never gotten before? I'm all for being safe, and I don't feel comfortable riding if I can't get very trusted and safe drivers.

Anyway, I have one issue so far: military access. I live near the Camp Lejeune, NC area, outside the base.

Right now, when I get a trip to deliver to the military base, I have to burn some time at the visitor's center, waiting for the customer to pick up their food, or cancel the trip if the customer can't pick up their food. I mean, I guess a free lunch is a pleasant thing to have, even it's unintended, but I don't want to make that a habit.

So, I got in touch with the folks at the vetting office at Lejeune, but they said that someone at Uber has to contact their office so they can provide the credentials needed for me to drive on base.

However, every time I contact the Uber support number (going to Help --&gt; Call Support in the Uber Driver app), I always get someone who is difficult to understand (often due to a foreign accent) and/or someone with a name that I can't pronounce, leading me to believe that Uber's customer support call center is somewhere outside the United States.

Says the passenger that puts the pin in the wrong location. “Dude how do u know I put the pin in the wrong spot!?” - you may ask. Cause I see this 10 times a day as a driver, we all do.

Here: open the Uber app and DRAG the pick up pin to you exact location - do this manually. Don’t rely on the “address” don’t rely on the GPS tracking. Pinch, Drag, and Drop the pin in the exact spot you want to be picked up. Then make sure your standing in said exact spot.

But as of yesterday it did this thing. I entered my pickup location, by destination, and the site shows that my trip is pre-scheduled for a split second before the page goes completely white and you have to re-load it. When you re-load it the trip is gone without any trace. It brings you back to the square-one enter your pickup location page. When I check my upcoming trips there is no record.

No tracker, no map, no pervious Uber trip record, but of course I was charged in the full as soon as I cancelled, having found another non-Uber ride. 

Today I woke up early and pre ordered a trip that showed up in my upcoming trips up until 10 minutes before it was supposed to arrive. Then there was no record of the trip being scheduled at all and the site wouldn’t let me order another. This is really dire to me because this is for someone who has no other means of transportation.

1600380393,uber,"Context: I recently started taking Uber daily to and from work since March (I don't have a car and live in Toronto so I don't feel safe on transit for now). When I started  5 months ago, my rating was a solid 4.93. Up until then, I had only used Uber for nights out. 

However, ever since I've been Ubering to and from work, my rating has been dropping like a stone and  I have NO IDEA WHY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Listen - I \*always\* make the first greeting - a friendly ""Hi!"" as soon as I open the door. I then proceed to sit there quietly, mask on; I never make a peep about the music, air, windows or anything else. I never take a phone call. I never initiate but always respond to the 1% of drivers that make small talk, although I have to say it's apparent that most guys have no interest in talking - at least 50% don't even bother responding to my initial greeting, which is ... rude. But anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Upon arrival to my destination, I give a loud ""thank you!"", every time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Five months later - Cue (what I can only assume to be) one star reviews - to make my rating keep tanking after almost every ride.

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell is going on? I'm a non-smoker (so I don't reek), I always greet and say thank you, and in between I just sit there not making a sound. 

&amp;#x200B;

Might this be related to sexism? As 99.9% of all the rides I've had have been from guys ... I've discussed this with a guy friend who says that he rides identically to me, yet his rating is 9.96. I can't help but feeling that if I were a guy myself, I would be considered the perfect passenger. 

The only other thing I can come up with - I work in a private, 10,000 sq foot home in the most prestigious neighborhood in the city, where my rides either drop me off at or pick me up from - could this be related? (Haters, that assume I live there and/or are rich? Spoiler: I don't and I'm not).

&amp;#x200B;

I literally cannot think of anything else. \*There is nothing else\*. And for those that say ""There \*must\* be something you're doing"" ... I wouldn't be posting here if I knew that were the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified of getting booted from Uber, all for ... greeting my driver, sitting there quietly, and thanking them upon arrival. I thought low ratings were supposed to weed out the undesirables, i.e. those that were constantly rude, obnoxious, distracting, etc to the driver.

Not sure if this is the place to ask, but I'll ask anyway. This was also posted on r/UberEATS

Last night I ordered a vegetarian meal from my favourite restaurant, I received an all meat meal instead (they must have given the delivery guy the wrong bag). I couldn't eat this even if I wanted to as meat makes me sick, so I wrote to uber about it, and sent in a photo for proof. They responded back that I was not eligible for a refund because apparently I complain too much. Has anyone ever encountered this? Also the last time I complained was when the delivery driver spilled the soup all inside the bag of food, turning $40 worth of sushi into mush. For that they gave me a $5 coupon which didn't even work. 

Anyway, I have been emailing back and fourth with them all day and I just keep getting the same cut-and-paste responses just saying sorry that they can't refund me. One response apologized for the appearance of my food so clearly they are not even really reading my emails. 

There is no phone number for customer service anymore, I asked if someone could call me and that was ignored, I reached out on twitter as well but got no response.

So far i had like 16 rides all of them were smooth and perfect the drivers were on time and never had any sort of problem at all. As a rider i also never done anything that would cause any sort of problem or inconvenience for the driver like closing the door too strongly or getting an uber while drunk or causing any sort of mess in their vehicle since i am and have always been aware that i am just a rider (sort of a guest) in their own private/personal vehicle and i always respected that in the same way i like people to respect my car when taking a ride with me (not in a business sense since i never worked with UBER but i considered doing that in the future). I also always wear the seatbelts as the first thing i do when i get into any vehicle and i always paid my rides with credit card so i am extremely confused on why would my rating be so low?

What I can think I might have done wrong before recently: 
- automatic location pin dropped on wrong side of the road once then I had to find the driver 
- I may have been late by maybe 2-3 minutes 
- I had just bought a cold milkshake before getting in the car but I put it in the cup holder but that was only a couple of times recently 
- I don’t feel like talking to drivers most of the time but I will give short responses. Some drivers really really try to force uninterested conversation from me and try to ask super personal questions then get mad at me that conversation isn’t good

- I do not give drivers directions 
- I don’t yell or complain about anything I barely speak to drivers at all unless they ask questions. 

- I don’t comment on the drivers car or the driver themself or anything

I have the following problem. My girlfriend of 4 years and I ended on bad terms. She had a lot of money issues which I idiotically helped her trying to be nice guy. I added her as a member of my family in Uber and at one point allowed her to schedule rides from her own personal Uber account using the “default family payment method” which was my card. 

I had 2 credit cards on Uber. The main one used as a default for rides scheduled by her and another card I never used and eventually that card got cancelled. Once I pulled the plug and ended things with her, I reported the credit card lost &amp; stolen + removed it as the default payment method from Uber family, leaving 1 credit card. This last credit card as mentioned above, I never used it and cancelled it. 

1 month after we’ve broken up I got a notification that she had done a ride and I got the regular Uber email receipt notification. She rode Uber twice until I realized, I had only took off the payment method NOT REMOVED HER as as a family member. 

I tried removing her from my family and Uber states I have an outstanding balance. Seemingly Uber allowed her to request rides use the default card (which was cancelled and not working) but still leaving an “outstanding balance” on my account. I am unable to remove her as I have an outstanding balance which I refuse to pay.

It just got extremely uncomfortable in the vehicle and my brother being my brother he was hella nervous so he gave him a 20$ for the small inconvenience. The guy just took it and pocketed it but honestly I believe if you were a good person in the slightest you’d say no and dont take it. I love my brother but sometimes he isn’t the brightest and can be easily taken advantage of so I asked for the 20$ back which the driver gave back but was not happy about it at all. His driving got extremely aggressive, zipping through traffic, we almost got into MULTIPLE collisions. We were in town 40 mph speed limits and we were going 80. Slamming on the break the whole works, sketchiest 20 minutes of my life. So as we were arriving to my destination I was absolutely livid. So I just made the remark of “what cereal box did you get it out of?” And he said get what? Acting confused but the dude knew I was going to retaliate with “your license” and he said he didn’t like the tone of my voice immediately. We are at a stop light a block from my destination and he whips his door open and can see him grabbing his gun that he had holstered. The 3 of us flew out the door faster than you could imagine. And he got back into his car and chased us! All for my smart ass remark which he definitely deserved. I flew into my secured building and called the police and they did nothing. They told me call Uber, so I try for an hour to figure out any type of way to contact Uber about this shit and can’t get a response or can really report this at all because I don’t think anyone is safe in the vehicle with this individual. What do I do?",Uber driver was getting way to aggressive dude.

1594807945,uber,"I (F20) work at a dialysis clinic about 9 minutes away from my apartment every morning at 5 AM. I schedule my Uber the night before for 4:40-4:50 AM. This morning, I was a bit late getting out of bed, so I messaged the driver about 15 minutes ahead of time that I would be coming down at 4:45, if that was alright with her. She didn't say anything. Once she arrived, I said ""Be right there"", and she didn't say anything. I made it downstairs two minutes later. I called her and she told me she was across the street at the gas station. I went over there and two people were getting in her back seat. She unrolled the window and confirmed my name, so I got in the front seat. Looking back, I should have just said I felt uncomfortable getting in the vehicle, but I was really tired and just kind of confused, and still needed to get to work. No one in the vehicle other than me was wearing a mask. Once I got in, she said she was going to ""give these guys a ride too, because they're stranded"". They had been at a bar down the street, illegally parked at a pharmacy, and their car got towed. One of the guys claimed his phone was dead so he couldn't call his own Uber. I guess it's a good thing their car was towed because they were very drunk and I think they were continuing to drink in the back. They had told the driver they lived close by, and she said ""okay, just tell me where to go and make it quick, because this girl obviously needs to get to work"" (probably referring to my scrubs). They did not live very close by. Eventually, she dropped them off near their house, and started heading back towards the clinic where I work, which was in the opposite direction. We had a nice conversation on the way there, and I told her it was okay if I was a couple minutes late. Meaning, sometimes I clock in at 5:02, and it's not a big deal. I clocked in at 5:20.

I would feel bad reporting her, because I know she was trying to be nice by helping those people out. She also mentioned Uber being her only job, and she has four kids at home. I really don't want to get someone like that fired. I'm also worried about her retaliating, because my name is very distinct, and she could easily find me on social media. She also knows where I live and work now.

1594790826,uber,"So uber is a shit company run by dirtbags, and we all know this. Their rewards program is profoundly un-generous. So my question is, what rewards option hurts Uber's bottom line the most. I don't care if it directly saves money for me because the savings is at most maybe $1 for every $100 spent back when they offered $5 uber cash. That option is gone now so its now even lower savings. Obviously the whole program is negligible in terms of how it effects my finances so I just want to figure out what hurts their bottom line the most for kicks.

My options are:
1) 25% off uber eats, minimum order value of $40, max savings $15.

This is probably the biggest ""savings"" on a surface look but uber gets a big purchase out of it that I probably wouldn't make otherwise, so its actually probably more of a win for them when they add all their extra charges and such.

2) $2 to international rescue committee. 

Good cause, tiny value. :/

3) Support Feeding America COVID-19 response fund.

Good cause, doesn't specify any specific amount. Would be super curious to know if anyone knows how much this donates.

4) Help fund education for driver's and their families. 

Would love to know more about this program and if anyone on here is a beneficiary, how good a program is it? Also again, they don't say how much it donates so if anyone knows, would love to have that info.

5) Highly rated drivers for two weeks.

I've never had a *not* highly rated driver. I've had lots good drivers, a whole lot of just fine drivers, plenty of bad drivers and a few terrible ""get me the fuck out of this car asap"" drivers. All of them had 4.8-5 stars. No correlation between rating and quality that I've noticed. Safe to say this does nothing and costs uber nothing.

6) 10% off next ride, maximum savings of $3.

Obviously this is the wrong pick, esp with my average ride being $9 before tip.

1594747148,uber,"English is my second language; the purpose of this post is to share my experience as a Five Start Uber driver.

**The context.**

I’m a Systems Analyst who decided to work for Lyft and Uber on 2019. I live in a rural community in Central Pennsylvania, some days (Specially Fridays), I used to start working at 5 a.m., completed a couple of rides, work in the office from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. and back to Uber sometimes until midnight.

I needed money so bad because the previous owner of my house hid the fact that the property needed to be connected to the Public Sewer, the township passed all the inspections for the septic tank during the purchasing process but a year after living in the property I found a notice asking me to connect the property to the sewer system in a six months period.

**Facts.** (From April 1, 2019 until December 31, 2019)

Passengers are 99% of the time very nice people.

Not nice passengers less than ten in total. It is safer to drive until 10 p.m., after that chances are more drunk/intoxicated passenger will be your riders trying to vape, smoke or make you stop, change the route, ask you to drive faster.

Passengers going to or coming from work usually don’t tip.

Passengers going to bars and restaurant on weekend usually tip, sometimes in cash. I got from a dollar to twenty. If they are drunk are more generous, sometimes they tip you the next day using the application.

For every 20 passengers in the car only half of them will talk, if they talk about 5 or 6 are taking the ride because they cannot drive their own cars due a DUI. Ladies get more DIU than men, around 7 females versus 3 males.

Extremely beautiful girls are usually married, engaged, have a handsome boyfriend or drive their own cars. I didn’t get any proposal from the opposite sex. For the record, I’m in my 50’s, I used to be handsome and young, only handsome now.

In a week I used to work for Uber of Lyft about 50 hours, including the whole weekend. No vacations at all.

Lyft does not compensate long distance pickup, Uber does although is just few cents per mile, they make a funny calculation playing with the driving time and the distance.

Online miles (that means getting pay and good for taxes) 4,907 miles for Lyft (299 rides) and 11,399 miles (865 rides) for Uber. Total paid miles 16,306.  Total miles for the car around 32,000.

Net payout, including tips for both platforms $13,680.

Approximately gas consumption per week $80 dollars, $3120 in the mentioned period.

Oil changes every month about $80 dollars.

Almost having an accident three times, If I feel tired I immediately stop driving. Safety is never on vacations with me.

Filing my taxes for 2019 was more expensive in H &amp; R Block because they filled more forms. I believe they charged an extra $100. In general, I paid more taxes because of the two jobs, makes sense of course.

**Conclusion**.

It is a privilege to live in this great country, I feel safe with plenty of opportunities to grow and make money if I’m in need of extra cash like it was my case.

If you are planning to rob a bank, Stop! It is better to get a car and work for Uber or Lyft. I found this job as a temporary solution for my financial problems. Drive to get over the bad times, working as a taxi/Uber/Lyft driver is not a job for a long period of time.

I did a couple of Uber eats and the numbers are worse.

1594432792,uber,"Tl;dr my Uber ride was charging me $39 and when the ride finished, I was charged $100. Tried to find a way to dispute the charge on the site to find no solution to my issue. Can I dispute this?

I needed to take a 50 min ride and checked fares an hour before I had to leave. Fare was $67. So when I went to see how much fare would be on a scheduled time, it offered a $39 ride. So I scheduled it.

I checked the app which showed me the expected amount would be between $39-$47. “Cool,” I thought. Not too bad. While on my ride, I checked my bank account and found that Uber had placed a hold for $43 AND $99. I was confused and so I checked the app. It showed me that I was expected to pay anywhere between $39 - $99. I was on the ride at that point on the freeway so I just assumed the app wouldn’t possibly charge me the full maximum amount.

Finally, after running my errand, I opened Uber to tip my driver and did so, only to find out I was charged $100. WHAT THE FUCK

This has happened a few times and the last time I sent a message to Uber about it, they never got back to me. But this was nowhere near what I expected to pay.

Looked for help for 10 min on the app to finally find their suggested help option regarding paying more than expected. It sent me to the site which ultimately got me to where I thought I wanted to be except they gave me a very limited set of suggested help options that I had already skipped over in the app.

I'm just curious why so I can change behavior if I'm doing something wrong. But you can't see why.

I'm rarely if ever late, I'm usually standing at the spot when the Uber shows up. I don't slam doors. I wear my seat belt. I'm curtious. And I wear my mask the entire time. And I always tip (usually 20%).

I don't talk to the drivers, is that it? I saw some places people saying that could be a cause of a low rating. That be ridiculous if that was the issue, I'm paying for a ride not a conversation. 

The only thing I can think concretely is I've taken my cat a couple of times in the ride when I have to drop her off for some checkups recently, but she's in a carrier and she's quiet and doesn't smell.

You should also note that while this my best attempt at making an unbiased telling of my side of the story, I was a part of this interaction and not just a bystander, so watch out for any biases that may be hidden to me. I don't speak very clearly at times. Also, I'll note that I must have gone on around 300 trips by since 2018 and have a 4.99 rating.

I went grocery shopping at a mini-mall, Ubering my way there. After checking out, I stepped outside with my shopping cart and called a ride using the app. I used a sidewalk in the corner of the shopping mall as my pick-up. The nearest available driver was summoned and arrived 15 min later. I recognized the color and model of the car. He parked about 300 ft away in front of a row of parked cars. I wheeled my cart over.  At around 100 ft, I waved at him thinking that that would identify me as the Uber passenger. I didn't receive an obvious response, so I waved again to make sure. At the time I arrived at the rear door of the vehicle, the scene looked like this from above.

&lt;--- Buildings ---&gt;

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sidewalk

Sidewalk           |---------------------------------------------------

|                                                    

\-------------------------|                &lt;--- Parked cars ---&gt;      &lt;car w/ brake lights on&gt;

&lt;Me&gt; &lt;shopping cart&gt;

&lt;Uber driver's vehicle&gt;

I opened the rear door and said ""hey."" I had quite a few bags with me and it would take a minute for me to load all of them on the car. The street was pretty busy. (Additionally, there was a car right behind us that had its brake lights on. I suspect that it was waiting to pull out, although I am not sure. I don't know whether the driver saw this car.) I leaned in and asked him, ""Do we want to move 30 ft forward so that we're out of traffic."" (My thinking was that I would load the bags so that we're not blocking cars or traffic, although I didn't make this clear to him. My feeling at the time was that it was obvious, but maybe I was wrong.) He faced me but didn't respond after about a second. I repeated my question. Again, he didn't respond. He was staring at me all the while. After another pause, I repeated my question for the third time.

There was another pause. He just said ""Close the door."" His tone was negative. I did, thinking that he would drive forward and I would walk after him. He made a left turn away from the sidewalk and drove away. About 30 seconds later, my phone buzzed and I received a message saying that my ride had been cancelled.

I called a second one and had no problem with it.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few things I may have done wrong:

1. I didn't wheel my cart over fast enough, making the driver impatient.
2. I don't recall identifying myself as the passenger other than by waving at him twice and saying ""hey"" after opening the door.
3. Asking him to move forward was rude and I should just load in the street.
4. I didn't speak clearly and he misunderstood what I was saying.
5. Repeating the question a few times may have been rude.

Uber drivers / people who understand social cues and politeness better than I do:

1. Did I do one of the things I listed above?
2. Did I do something wrong that I'm just completely oblivious to?
3. Was the driver the one at fault here?

Please be honest with me. I don't want to upset any else if I'm at fault.

1594352058,uber,"I just got one of those [Zenfox T3 dash cam](https://www.zenfox.com/en/dash-cams/21-zenfox-t3-3ch-triple-channel-2k-front-1080p-ir-interior-1080p-rear-wi-fi-gps-dash-camera.html). It's a triple camera system (Front, interior of the cabin and back cam). Perfect for Uber/Lyft drivers at it will capture everything from the outside to the inside of the car for insurance purposes. The front video resolution is in Quad HD (2560 x 1440P at 60FPS) while both the interior and back video resolution is Full HD (1920 x 1080P at 30FPS). It has built-in dual-band Wi-Fi and built-in GPS logger, so you don't have to buy an extra add-on, which is a big plus!

When I first opened the packaging I was very impressed with it, it feels like a premium device. Each camera was delivered in its own silicone bag, which was nestled in a custom cut sponge cushion. Taking everything out of the box, the accessories provided are really nice too. It came with a USB to microSD adapter (and it's well build too, not those cheap ones you usually get with a product). The best accessory provided is the trim tool which helps tuck the cables in your trim, this was a life saver as I never ran cables through the car before, but this made it so easy to lift up the trim and tuck the cable under the trim. Also comes with a long wire to run from the front cam to the back cam. It was a little too long for me, but I always appreciate long wires since you can easy just tuck it away in the trim and not have an issue with cable length, so that's a big plus. As for the power cable, I found that to be a little short by like 3 feet for a clean factory look, but doesn't look that bad as you only see the power cable when sitting in the passenger seat.

The Zenfox T3 came with all necessary hardware to get it going:

* Front Camera Quad HD (2560 x 1440P 60FPS) with the interior camera built in (1920 x 1080P 30FPS)
* Rear Camera Full HD (1920 x 1080P 30FPS)
* Main power cable (12V Lighter to USB mini-B)
* Inter-camera cable (USB mini-B to USB mini-B)
* 1 removable mounting bracket per camera with preinstalled 3M adhesive pad
* 2 extra 3M adhesive pads per mounting bracket
* A Micro SD to USB adapter
* Trim tool with one end being big with the other end being small, so 2 sizes in one.
* USB-A to mini-B cable
* User manual

The camera itself feels solidly built and feels like a premium cam, there are no flimsy parts in the joints. Video quality is amazing (Will post videos soon as my internet upload sucks) especially at night with both the front cam and the infrared interior cam. Easy to set up and get working. Manual was easy to follow and clear. (Not like those IKEA instructions which makes you pull your hair out). I did however notice that the unit did get quite hot and being in the summer heat doesn't help with that. The app that's used to connect to the camera is extremely straight forward and the best part is it DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO SIGNUP FOR AN ACCOUNT. (I brought one of those PUR water filter for the faucet and to use the app it makes you sign up for an account, which asks for your full name, gender, zip code, etc. That is extremely ridiculous especially for a WATER FILTER!)

Overall I would highly recommend this dash cam. It's a high quality cam. You should absolutely have one of these if you're a Uber/Lyft driver, no doubt. If you aren't, then it still gives you the most protection out of any cam I know of with the 3-channel video.

1594260435,uber,"Let me educate you on the following since apparently Uber has not explained to you how multiorders work.

Multiorders are just like UberPool, but with deliveries. We are assigned two or more orders (mostly two) from the same restaurant or two nearby restaurants. The system then takes us to the closest customer, and hopefully the customer has input the right address. WE DO NOT DECIDE WHO TO DELIVER FIRST. And we cannot change the order because the first person pays the corresponding part and the second pays the distance that you would have paid if there was not another delivery. Besides we don’t know your location until we finish the first delivery.

When you text a courier “how much more for you to come”, like an asshole did tonight, we can screenshoot the text and report you after we downvote you for rude behavior. I got downvoted by the moron that texted me that and according to the message that support gave me the customer is going to be warned that such behavior is not tolerated. 

If you cannot wait and are hungry like a lion then get on your car and get your food yourself. We are risking ourselves doing this for you to annoy us with moronic texts rushing us. Look at you app and when it says that the person is doing another delivery, be an adult and wait. There is traffic. There are accidents.

1591564800,uber,"Super fed up with the price gouging of Uber and I want to delete my account. 

I take my normal route almost daily; when taken I usually do round trip, which is normally $10-$14 a ride on Uber and $13-$16 bucks on Lyft. One way. A 13 minute, 8 mile drive. 

During the Covid my same Lyft ride has only increased $1-$3 bucks more depending on time. While my Uber ride has increased to anywhere between $20-$50 more! 

Even my short trip for work (less than 1.5 miles) costs me $5 with Lyft and $13 with Uber right now. 

Every blue moon I’ll open the Uber app randomly and the price is similar to Lyfts pricing for my destination. Then what’s crazy is, I literally close the Uber app and open it less than 30 seconds later (always check against Lyft for best pricing) and the Uber prices have skyrocketed!!!

 I live in a pretty lame downtown city (Kansas City), we don’t have major traffic unless your driving to the subs. My route in particular is never busy when I take it. Sometimes it maybe in the middle of the day, or dead midnight. 

There’s no changes on the price gouging I’m receiving  from Uber no matter the time of day or demand. 
I truly believe Uber has turned on some “setting” in its algorithms and it’s just not operating correctly in my area. 

So I just want to completely deactivate the account. I don’t want to simply delete it, I want Uber to know they’ve lost a customer. 

Before you comment here are my canned responses. 
“Take your money elsewhere” - I have. 
“Try a different time” - I have.

1591554651,uber,"I understand a lot of drivers do not have much trouble with getting ride requests or delivery orders while still finishing an active one. But some in some areas the Uber map and positioning system is utter shit. Like here, nearly half of all deliveries the customer lies off the pin point and at least a quarter put the address wrong- way wrong. Say many miles off. I remember once I had a pending new order while finishing one and when delivering the guy called me and he was 4 miles away. I had to cancel the other order. For multi orders it is just horrible when the first customer gets the address all wrong. Twice I got downvoted after multi orders which is why this is the only time when I am forced to accept deliveries that can put me in trouble.

For rides, while GPS positioning works better, some riders request stops, and when another ride is pending this could pose problem. But you know what happens when you don’t please the rider- from low ratings to false reports, it seems to me that back to back trips are serious trouble at least for me.

1591388548,uber,"Just got an unsolicited email about Uber standing behind the BLM movement.  Congrats dumb dumb, you're supposed to or you're a racist.  But I take umbrage with Uber using this for a marketing stunt, and moreso sending unsolicited emails voncerning political statements.  If you really feel that way, write an open letter on your website landing page, not some cowardly email 95% of people won't read.  

Also, don't send me an email I can't respond to, with little to no chance for me to give feedback, so here's my open letter response since you like to yell then run away (I included ubers message as the words are kind, but now is not the time to boost your public image):


Ubers email:
Let me start by saying I wish I never had to send this email.

I wish that the lives of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless others weren’t so violently cut short. I wish that institutional racism, and the police violence it gives rise to, didn’t cause their deaths. I wish that all members of our Black community felt safe enough to move around their cities without fear. I wish that I didn’t have to try to find the words to explain all of this to my two young sons.

But I’ve been given hope this week by hundreds of thousands of peaceful protestors around the world demanding change. I am committed to being part of that change.

As a company, we believe that everyone has the right to move freely, no matter where they live or the colour of their skin. We’re proud of how Uber has helped improve transportation equity over the last decade. But the reality remains that members of the Black community often don’t feel safe to move freely in many places. And they still face enormous barriers that others do not.

This is a reality we should not perpetuate or accept. We must do better.

We know there is no easy solution to the problems we have faced for centuries. We also know that we need to devote our time, energy and resources toward making a difference. That’s why we’re making a number of commitments that we will uphold not just this week, but for years to come:
We are committed to driving lasting change through criminal justice reform. On Sunday, we announced a $1 million donation to the Equal Justice Initiative and Center for Policing Equity to support their important work in making racial justice more than just a promise.
We are committed to creating a community that treats everyone equally and with dignity. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or racism on our platform, as outlined in our Community Guidelines. We will hold everyone who uses Uber accountable to these standards of basic respect and human decency. I respectfully ask anyone not willing to abide by these rules to delete Uber.
We are committed to supporting the Black community. As a starting point, we will use Uber Eats to promote Black-owned restaurants while making it easier for you to support them with no delivery fees. And in the coming weeks, we will offer discounted rides to Black-owned small businesses, who have been hit hard by COVID-19, to help in their recovery.
We are committed to making Uber a diverse and inclusive place for people of colour to work and thrive. While we have more work to do, we have tied our senior executives’ pay to measurable progress on our diversity goals, and will continue to publish data on our workforce so the public can hold us accountable. We’re also committed to expanding opportunities for drivers and delivery people, including through education opportunities and skills training.
We know this isn’t enough. It won’t be enough until we see true racial justice. But we plan to work day in and day out to improve, learn, and grow as a company.

Lastly, let me speak clearly and unequivocally: Black Lives Matter.

Dara Khosrowshahi

My response:
You wish a lot of things... I wish Uber wouldn't use this political protest as a marketing ploy. GFY for trying to make money off of systemic racism issues.  Don't reply to this; you did enough damage.  

And don't use my email for non business related politics ever again.  You want a soap box to show how woke you are, write an open letter.  How about discounted rides for those helping in the demonstrations or for health workers tending to fallen protesters?  How about delivering free coffee to the front lines in an attempt to calm tensions?  Oh wait, that takes effort... Not good for shareholders.

1590967754,uber,"When the pandemic crisis started, I turned off the X ride requests and only did UberEats, while watching how the virus behaved here. Of course the media, the government and all forces possible instilled one of the strongest panic/hysteria reactions I never imagined to see here. So far, hospitals are BELOW the usual for this time of the year, and around 62 confirmed deaths, most of them old people. Not to say that this is not tragic, but it is not worse than the usual every year. Therefore, I reactivated the X rides although I have been doing so in “steps” and not exactly like before the pandemic started. For example I am still not picking at the airport and I am preferring deliveries on touristic zones, as I have noticed there may still be a few people visiting although they are probably people who stayed here after coming in March, since most of the tourists come from the hotspot (Tri-State area). There is still nothing to do here for tourists- beaches are closed for sun tanning or partying- you can only walk or briefly get into the water (but today I passed through a usually heavily visited beach area by locals and there were a few people there not doing what we are allowed exactly). The rainforest is closed and tourists are not allowed to go to Vieques and Culebra, and the bio bays are closed. No tourist facility and attraction is open. Right now, there is nothing to do in Puerto Rico except basically exercising and working. 

So I work normally in the suburb of Caguas, south of San Juan, and I stayed within the limits of that town for a month doing ONLY deliveries, because is both the closest to where I live and the San Juan suburb with the least covid cases, but eventually I reactivated the rides and recently I started picking people again in San Juan and other areas; but I have gotten requests from very far. Normally, as expected, San Juan is the area with the most drivers. But last Friday something happened for the first time ever- I got a request from San Juan, and I was in Caguas. 25 minutes south. The reverse happens often as there are not many drivers in Caguas. I live east, in the coast, but nobody requests Uber here and Eats is not available so I have to go there. Today my app pinged almost instantly after dropping the riders or delivering the food. I made good money considering we are still under a super ridiculous curfew that starts at 7pm. It seems we are only some 5 people doing rides in the entire San Juan metro area. There are much more people doing Eats and to be honest deliveries are still a better deal since tourism is the main engine for the X rides and there is almost no tourism, but people still need to eat and like in the US and elsewhere UberEats has seen a hike while X has plummeted.",Almost no drivers in Puerto Rico

1588732506,uber,"Yesterday I took an Uber trip that should have been about $22, but instead it was $64.

While I was in the car making small talk, the driver told me she forgot her backup battery/charger for her phone, and it was about to run down so I’d probably be her last trip.

The trip didn’t take any longer than it would have normally taken (about 15 minutes) because the roads are very clear, but I assume her battery ran down because once I got home, the Uber app kept reporting that I was still traveling for approx. 40 minutes to an hour. The ETA kept bumping forward one minute at a time. Ironically, I figured at the time I should cancel the trip but I didn’t want the driver to lose out on any fees.

Anyway, finally it registered as completed (the driver must have recharged her phone) and I was charged an exorbitant amount for the trip. Presumably when the driver reconnected and completed the trip it showed that we traveled a lot longer or more miles than we actually did.

I did ""review my fare"" on Uber support and was immediately told they were standing by the higher fare. I thought of reaching out to the driver, but the only way I know to do so is to hit ""I lost an item"" which I thought might register as sketchy with support. I’m assuming the driver wouldn’t have had any motivation to help me either, cause I was asking for a fare reduction.

Finally after multiple dead ends I selected ""I was charged multiple times for this trip, even though that really doesn't fit my issue, and wrote notes explaining what happened. Uber adjusted my fare.

1588728179,uber,"I will be posting this in r/UberEats as well.

TL;DR- The current theory right now is that someone is using my address as an Uber Eats delivery spot, in order to lure drivers out to a specific location, so they can be followed and robbed. Although I am receiving deliveries that I did not order all day, every day, the local precinct recommends contacting Uber Support, and Uber Support is all but completely useless. I am desperate for a solution (other than moving). 

Long Story- For about the past month or so, I’ve received multiple Uber Eats deliveries to my address EVERY DAY, none of which I have ordered. It was originally thought to be a mistake, that someone was continually re-ordering, unaware that they had the wrong address on their account. The weird thing is, it was only beverages, like a single can of Coke from a local restaurant or a large McDonald’s soda. Despite being strange and unwanted, no action was taken at this point. 
Fast forward a couple weeks of having this occur day in and day out, and suddenly there are detectives knocking on my door. Why? An Uber RIDE was ordered for a house on my block earlier that week. A driver accepted the ride, arrived, and left after not finding a rider, only to be followed by people impersonating police officers, who then beat and robbed her. 

The kicker? The phone number that ordered THAT ride, was the same number that was ordering food to be delivered to my address. The detectives said they called the phone number and got through to a male voice. When that phone number was tried again the next day, it was deactivated. 

Kicker #2: That Uber driver, and every Uber Eats delivery driver to come to my address since then, has confirmed that they were contacted by a random phone number claiming to be a representative from Uber, who requested their personal information such as make/model of their car and approximate wages from Uber- leading me to believe this is more of a scam on UBER than on me. 

The detectives claimed to put a “block” on my address to prevent any future deliveries, but within 24 hours they started up again. 

I’ve contacted Uber Support dozens of times, through the app AND social media, and they have been absolutely no help at all. Some of their responses are as if they didn’t even read my concerns. While at first I felt I was being harassed and was concerned for my own safety, especially cause some of these orders came early in the morning (1am/2am), now I fear more for the drivers who have no idea what they could be stepping into by accepting this random order. 

If anyone has any advice about how to figure out what’s going on, or actually get Uber to help somehow, that would be much appreciate. At this point I just want the deliveries to stop. Not to sound insensitive to any victims of any Uber related scam, but if you’re going to scam people, switch up the address every once in a while...",Uber Scam

1588229041,uber,"Okay, so I did Uber the last two weeks of November and the last two weeks of December, I was going to do the last two weeks of January but didn’t due to Covid-19.  Following the stay at home guidelines, I am no longer doing Uber and applied for unemployment.  I was making about $200 a night, for about $1500 a month.  I haven’t received any notice back from unemployment.  But I’m worried because it seems for eligibility for PUA guidelines says “The PUA program provides up to 39 weeks of benefits, which are available retroactively starting with weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 27, 2020, and ending on or before December 31, 2020. “... since my last day of work was December 31 (considering I work the last two weeks of every month), does this mean I’m ineligible for PUA?  Has anyone filed with a last day of work before January 27 for PUA and been approved? I mean there’s no way doing Uber complies with the 6ft social distance order, so what do I do?  It’ll be kind of stupid to have me work a day just to fall under those dates.. This is what the department of labor states: 


This is the only guidance I found on the Dept of Labor site:
You may be eligible for PUA, depending on your personal circumstances. A gig economy worker, such as a driver for a ride-sharing service, is eligible for PUA provided that he or she is unemployed, partially employed, or unable or unavailable to work for one or more of the qualifying reasons provided for by the CARES Act. For example, a driver for a ride-sharing service may be forced to quit his or her job if he or she was diagnosed with COVID-19 by a qualified medical professional, and although the driver no longer has COVID-19, the illness caused health complications that render the driver objectively unable to perform his or her essential job functions, with or without a reasonable accommodation. Similarly, under an additional eligibility criterion established by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 2102(a)(3)(A)(ii)(I)(kk), a driver who receives an IRS Form 1099 from the ride-sharing service may qualify for PUA benefits if he or she has been forced to suspend operations as a direct result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, such as if an emergency state or municipal order restricting movement makes continued operations unsustainable. Relatedly, widespread social distancing undertaken in response to guidance from federal, state, or local governments may so severely reduce customer demand for a driver’s services as to force him or her to suspend operations, and thus make the driver eligible for PUA.",[New Jersey] Uber PUA

The other day I found out that I was unable to make any deliveries and I was confused about the nature of this. I assumed it was because my insurance was 3 days from expiring. Luckily my new insurance card came in yesterday and I took a picture and it still wasn’t working. So I called support and spoke to them and later they said that due to an abnormally high number of undelivered orders, I am banned. This is absolutely absurd to me because I’ve made 13 deliveries and of those 13, 11 of them gave me a tip so that would obviously mean it got delivered and they optioned to give me a tip. 1 of the ones without a tip I handed it to the customer so there was no confusion about it getting there. Then the last one I had placed on the front porch and sent them a text saying that due to the COVID-19 situation and to minimize contact, I left it at their front door. They also didn’t give me a tip and I have 1 report on my account for “unprofessional behavior” I assume for that. However the claim that anything fraudulent happened is completely absurd and I was wondering if there is any recourse I could take to resolve this misunderstanding. I get that it is my word against theirs, and that they are a corporation so I don’t really matter but like the fact that they used the word fraudulent could make one assume they can take legal action against me.

So we Uber drivers have to repay a loan almost double original principal thanks to a high interest rate of 14%.  Some people on r/personalfinance even reported 25% interest rate.

She quietly responds with “ok I guess”. I start the trip and notice it’s over 35 miles away and close to a 40 minute ride. I immediately think she must’ve fought with her boyfriend and instead of spending the night she is heading home. About 2 or 3 minutes into the trip she requests a song to be played. I inform her she can hook up to the stereo via Bluetooth and play whatever songs she wants. She agrees and I pull over to set it up as the vehicle does not allow connecting to a new device unless the vehicle is parked. She gets it connected quickly and we are back on the road. She asks me if I’m “ready to listen to some depressing shit”. I just let her know she can play whatever she wants and that it’s fine with me. Midway through the song she says “I know this is a weird request but will you hold my hand please”. I turn to look at her and can see the sadness she is in so I ask her if she wants to sit up front in the passenger seat. She says yes and I pull over so she can jump up front. As I’m pulling off again she puts her arm around my arm so our inner elbows are against each other and she leans her head on my shoulder. She is quiet for a few minutes before she starts to smell my shirt and continue to lean on my shoulder. Trying to make her feel better I say “it’s gonna be ok” (before I forget, I don’t know what songs she was playing but it was super depressing, she was not lying about that). We are less than 10 minutes into the trip and she says “I’m gonna do LSD”. Confused I ask what she said and she repeats the same thing. She informs me that she’s getting dropped off at a ex coworker’s house to go do LSD with him. She says she’s been drunk for the past 6 days straight because she’s always depressed. I ask her if she thinks it’s a good idea to be going over to a guy’s house at 130 in the morning to go do LSD and she says “no it’s not but it’s too late he ordered me this ride and already bought the drugs”. I then say it sounds like he’s trying to take advantage of her since she has been drunk for 6 days and the fact that it’s 130 in the morning and he lives over 35 miles away and she says that she knows he probably is. I try to say maybe she shouldn’t go and that I can take her back home if she wants but she says just to continue the trip. I ask her why she is going to him and not the other way around and she says he could’ve came over to her place but he said he was on his way when he got pulled over so he couldn’t make it to her. So I then ask if she got roommates and she says she lives with her boyfriend and that he was at home sleeping. I then say that’s why he didn’t come over and that he was probably lying about getting pulled over and just didn’t want her boyfriend to find out or get involved. She tells me she does whatever she wants and that nobody can tell her what to do, including her boyfriend. She says she’s always depressed and I ask if her boyfriend tries to help her cope with it and she said he tries but it doesn’t work so he gives up a lot. We talk a little more as I continue to try and make her rethink her decision of going to do LSD. She makes a call to the guy who requested the ride and let’s him know how far out we are. After the call I ask her what her name is so she gives it to me. She asks me if I want to take her number down after the ride and I say sure so maybe next time she feels like going to do LSD she can talk to me first and I can convince her not to. That’s when she opens up to me more and tells me that she tried to previously kill herself 4 times. While trying not to intrude too much I ask her what was the reasons for trying to kill herself. I tell her if she doesn’t want to talk about it that it’s fine she doesn’t have to but I tell her I’m just trying to help her. She says she doesn’t like herself but would not elaborate on what she didn’t like about yourself. That’s when she says she doesn’t want to talk about it anymore and asks me if I wanted to kiss a little bit. I ask her if she’s serious and she says yes she wants to make out with me. I hesitate because she told me she has a boyfriend but I agree. At this point I’m thinking to myself that if I say no will it make her feel more depressed about herself and instead of helping her I may be causing her more problems. I’m thinking this might be a bad decision but go with it anyway. So she leans over and starts to kiss me while I’m driving down the freeway going about 80 miles an hour or so. I try to focus on driving and remind her that I need to be able to see the road. We probably had just under 20 minutes or so left on the trip so she would be switching between kissing me and sending a few texts to who I believe to be the guy waiting on her (never asked cause it wasn’t my business) because she would ask where we were. We took an exit and pulled up to a red light at an intersection. From some reason the light took what seemed like forever and we were the only cars in the road. We continued to make out and was able to get more into it as I was not distracted with trying to drive while at the light. She took off her seatbelt and got more comfortable in her seat. While making out she grabbed my left hand and rubbed it on her right boob. So naturally I grabbed her boob and felt it up while making out. She then lifted her shirt up and exposed both of her breasts to me. I paused and enjoyed the view for a split second or 2 and then leaned in. I licked her left nipple while I played with her right for a few seconds. Both were pierced with a little inch bar (I don’t know what it’s called). She smiles and is enjoying the stimulation. I then start kissing her again and she lowers her shirt. All of this happens while waiting for the red light that seemed like forever, although it may have only been 5 minutes or so. We both mentioned how the light seemed long and I actually got tired of waiting and made a right turn, then a quick u turn, and another right turn (so we are now going the same direction as before) just to get around the light. Her seatbelt is back on and we are on our way again. She once again leans on my shoulder and continues to smell my shirt as we make our way. We were about 5 minutes away when I ask her again if she’s sure about this and she tells me that she thinks this is a terrible idea but it’s too late to back out. I ask what her boyfriend might think if she doesn’t get home before he wakes up and she says she will definitely not make it back in time and that he’s probably gonna be really mad at her. I ask her if she still wants my number and she says yes so I give it to her. She takes my number down and I tell her if she needs to talk she can hit me up. She sends a few texts to the guy letting him know we should be there soon. She mentions to me that she texted him the driver might hate me and he asked “why what did you do” and that he’s worried about his rating on the app. She thinks it’s cute he’s worried and I let her know that I don’t hate her. As we pull up to the house the guy exits the house and starts walking toward the vehicle. As he gets closer to the vehicles she leans over to hug me and says thanks. I tell her to have a good night and to stay safe. I drive off and think to myself what the hell just happened and if this is normal for driving with Uber. 2 days later my account gets put on hold and I’m told to call support but can’t get ahold of anyone as they are already closed when my account froze. The next day I get a phone call and an investigator informs me that my account has been put on hold because a rider accused me of something. He wouldn’t say what I’m being accused of and didn’t even say the exact trip. He only said yes that’s the trip in question when I explained to him about a male requesting a ride but a female was the rider. I told him everything except the part about the boobs, I thought best that I leave that part out but mentioned the kissing and what we talked about. He wouldn’t let me know if las enforcement was notified or not and said he can’t tell me anything else. A day later I get an email saying my account is permanently disabled and I have no reason why except that I broke the community guidelines. I want to know if the girl is claiming that I sexually assaulted her (which I didn’t and let her initiate everything) or if it’s just the guy mad at me because of the hug he saw or the fact that he somehow found out she saved my number (the investigator from Uber knew one of us exchanged numbers and was sneaky with the way he asked the question). 

Should I be worried about law enforcement? Can I go to law enforcement and ask them to look into this more on my behalf? Do I not have a right to know what I’m being accused of or under what guidelines is Uber disabling my account? I would think a way around their confidentiality agreement would be to inform me of the guideline that I broke right?",Account deactivated

When I log in with my email online, it says I can change my number, but I need to log in with the app to do so. On the app, it asks for my phone number. If I put in my CURRENT phone number, it asks for the password. This indicates to me that the last person with my current phone number had an account. I select ""forgot password?"" and it prompts me to enter an email address. When I enter this email address, it says this email is not associated with this account.

1582832049,uber,"Last week I was in Madrid with clients. Before leaving our hotel I opened my Uber app to see the fare to the city centre. Before I could get any further it requested my passport details which I did not have to hand.

As a result my client booked the car through his app. After being in the city for several hours my client booked the return journey.

At this moment Uber tried to take the total fare from my card four times, however my bank blocked it as fraud.

My client was charged for the journey £40.64 and this is the exact amount they tried to take from me.

Uber claim it is a pre authorization charge, yet I never booked a car, never confirmed a car or indeed a destination so how is this even possible?

Why did they try 4 times?

It would seem to me a very under hand tactic.

Uber have no explanation as to why they attempted to pre authorise the card despite me not even booking a car. All they do is repeat themselves and say it's policy to pre authorise.

Maybe I pressed some buttons too quickly, in a wrong sequence, or something, but when I went to rate/tip I got this message of ""You have already rated this driver"" or something along those lines.  The point is that it was **NOT** giving me the screen to **ADD** a tip.  At the moment, as far as I knew, it was not going to let me do so.

Lucky I had the thought to try once more, a short while later, and the app then did allow me to do the 5-star rating + Tip.  So, for that ride at least, all's well that ends well.

The reason I'm bringing it up here is in case other riders received a similar message but may not even **think** to check again shortly.  This is, then, directed to:

Not only that, I contacted your support, explained my situation, and for some reason, I was charged twice for the Uber ride????? So I was charged 38.97$ for the first wrong ride, I for some reason was charged an additional 30.97$

And the support member ended up “fixing” my rate to 28$?? For a ride that was supposed to be 7-8$, and it overall cost me 69.64$

I contacted support again and I’ve yet to get a reply, and I showed screenshots and everything","A normally 7-8$ trip ended up costing me 69.94$, thanks to a driver who didn’t end the trip when he was supposed to."

1582527133,uber,"Hey, I took an uber back from the airport tonight and had my first experience with the lost item fee and had some questions. When I got out of the car I left my keys in the back seat and started to walk away from the car, not more than thirty seconds later my driver calls out saying I left my keys. I thank him and tip him 5 bucks for this because I’m grateful that he noticed I left them. Now I’ve been charged a 15 dollar fee for this return but to me that doesn’t seem really fair since he didn’t have to drive to come bring them to me, it was only 30 seconds of his time after dropping me off. I feel this is a bit unfair since the 15 dollar fee is to compensate for the time and effort of returning a lost item, but I didn’t even realize this counted as a lost item or that I would be charged for it since he hadn’t even moved from the spot and I was less than 20 feet away from the car. I guess I can understand that this is technically a lost item but I just don’t feel like this is a cool move by uber since I’m paying 15 dollars for my driver to spend an extra 30 seconds to tell me I left my keys.

1579921321,uber,"I am relatively new to using Uber.  Recently I took a vacation with four other friends and we often traveled together via UberXL.  UberXL seems to advertise a service that can handle 5 passengers - but out of the 15 or so rides we took, two rides shoes up with vehicles that could only handle 4 passengers.  The drivers of those rides shrugged and told us to cancel the ride.  The first time we happened we could not figure out how to properly do this in time (it wanted to charge us $5 or so to cancel) and the driver cancelled instead.  The second time this happened the (different) driver shrugged and told us to cancel - when we complained that that would cost us $5, he said he didn’t know how to cancel.  I told him that I bet he’s figure it out and sure enough 30 seconds later he did.  

My question is - are these drivers trying to beat the system by saying they can do the XL service when they can’t?  Or is Uber advertising them as being capable of something they can’t do against their will?  Or is something else going on?  It’s odd that you’d have a service that specifically says it can do more than 4 passengers and then have it show up and act befuddled that you have more than 4 passengers.

Uber’s response was to reduce my fare to what it would actually have cost for me to take the route from my home to the place I got out of the car, resulting in a slight reduction from what I would have paid if I had been taken to my destination. The upshot: I paid about double the original fare.

So I’m ranting yes, but it’s very poor service not to waive the original fare in this situation. They know he’s a terrible driver. Who gets a 4.43.

1579536548,uber,"Serious question here … apologies if it's a bit long.

I'm general manager for a small home-located business.  Our employees drive company pickup trucks on their routes during the day and are allowed to drive the trucks home as opposed to having to drive to our property and switch out vehicles day after day.

We have an employee that we are going to need to terminate soon due to a pattern of dishonesty and poor performance after numerous ""second chances.""  When the day comes we're going to have to call him here to the office, inform him he's fired and explain why, and then he's going to need to remove whatever personal items he might have in the truck and leave the premises.  However, his home is at least a 20-minute drive away from here and I don't know that anyone would be readily available to give him a ride.  This is a mid-sized town and we're just outside the city limits, so it's not like there's a public place within walking distance he could go to wait.  There's also no public transportation to speak of.

He's married but his wife works and wouldn't necessarily be available.  He might have a friend or another family member that could give him a lift but there's no guarantee.  Either I or the company owner could drive him to his house and drop him off but that's awkward for us, undignified for him, etc.  This guy isn't really into technology and I doubt he's got Uber or Lyft or any other ride-share apps on his phone, although those are readily available here.  I've got the apps and I use them occasionally.  Would it be fine to just call an Uber on my app and arrange for his ride home?  He's not a violent or threatening person.  Any personal items he was taking out of the truck could probably fit in a modest-sized box.

1579482547,uber,"I have an idea for Uber to add a new feature in the rider app. Throughout the past few years, I have mentally been keeping track of how many Uber/Lyft drivers prefer the front when I ride alone. When I started using ridesharing in my local area back in 2017, about 8 out of 10 of Uber/Lyft drivers preferred passengers to sit in the front seat. When I asked them about sitting in the front seat, they responded with one or more of the following statements listed below:

• “I don’t really care where you sit. As long as you don’t harass me or steal my stuff, I am fine.

• ""You paid for the ride, so you are the one who chooses where to sit.”

• “If something dangerous were to happen, I have more control when the passages is up front”

• ""A friend of mine was deactivated for not allowing front seat riders, so you should be able to choose your preferred seat.”

• ""I have had lots of riders who get carsick in the back and have never told me. I often find bubble gum stuck the the back seat.""

• ""The GPS is horrible, so I enjoy it when riders are up front who can help me navigate in case I miss a left turn.""

• ""I always find front seat drivers to be very friendly. Uber/Lyft is meant to be social and fun”

• ""I feel very uncomfortable when I have any rider who sits directly behind my seat”

• “Only kids sit in the backseat”

As of this and last year, I now notice that only 3 out of 10 drivers prefer the front seat. Those other 7 out of 10 drivers prefer the pax to be in the back. I have also noticed that 3 out of those 7 drivers will lock the front door, put the front seat all the way up, and point to the back when I try to get into the front seat. I ask them if I can sit up front and they say “no, please sit in the back”. This is a rude first impression in my opinion. I mention to them that I get motion sickness when in the back and that I need to visually see where I am going instead of looking out the side window where everything is going twice as fast. To them, that’s an excuse. These drivers always mention one or more of the following statements listed below before and during the ride and many of you agree with them:

• ""Uber is a taxi sir; customers must sit in the back due to safety issues.""

• ""I have had many different riders who either grabbed my steering wheel or played with my radio. You are not going to be one of them. It's my car, it's my rules.""

• ""I feel very uncomfortable sitting next to a stranger who I have no idea what could do next.""

• ""It’s too personal. You are not a friend; you are a random stranger to me.""

• ""People with motion sickness still have no choice but to sit in the back of a taxi. Same rules apply dude. The GPS is very smart and you can still help me even in the back.""

•""It is basic training to sit in the back. Do you sit in the front with the bus driver? Do you sit in the front with a pilot? No!”

•”I have a better view of you through my mirror when you are in the back sir”.

Sadly, I disagree with them. As a social guy, I always want to be up front and chat with the driver. I doze off when in the back due to motion sickness and Uber’s messed up GPS navigation system makes it even worse. I tend to wake up noticing they are dropping me off in the wrong plaza. When riding in the front, I am happy and cheerful. When riding in the back, I get reminded of the bad days I had dealing with unreliable taxi drivers and I often tend to watch videos on my phone because I don’t like looking through the side window or at the passenger seat. As a result, I am grumpy and tired. On top of that, I feel unsafe when I cannot visually see where I am in front of me in case the driver hits a deer at night. So, I need to know if my driver needs me in the back beforehand. To fix this issue, Uber needs to add a new feature that notifies the rider whether the driver allows the front seat or not. Not another new service like Uber Shotgun, but a feature in the app for riders. Maybe for now, I can leave the driver a note that I need to be in the front seat.

You may think this is utter nonsense, but to me, it is a big issue.",Notification for drivers who prefer the front

1579463539,uber,"Hi folks,

Something to watch out for.

Recently myself and friends in Edinburgh have noticed that drivers are charging us for ‘wait time’ on our receipts when we have been there on arrival of the car.

Wait time is meant to begin after the driver has been there for more than 2 minutes.  These drivers are clearly pushing that they have arrived before actually doing so to try and get an extra 25p on their fare, or more.

I’ve reported a few to Uber and have been refunded for the wait time on each occasion and been ‘assured’ that they are aware of the issue and that they are working on means of resolving it.

Uber, in Edinburgh, has already dramatically increased in price and I’ve personally caught drivers using other people’s accounts on shifts.  Don’t let these guys get away with fraudulently charging you wait time as well.

If you do notice this on your receipt, please give the drivers an appropriate rating and report them to Uber.  You can also report all issues to your local council too.",Beware - Drivers charging fraudulent wait time.

For the life of me, I cannot understand why I have a 4.8 rating on Uber.  I have seen other threads, and have see people commenting on tipping. Yes, I tip on every ride.

1579424792,uber,"I was wondering if drivers get “strikes” or any sort of demerits? I tried filing a complaint against a driver who seemingly forced me to cancel a ride. The response from Uber was lukewarm and just told me I would be refunded my cancellation fee (which I wasn’t charged to begin with). Which would have been enough if I didn’t feel he was probably also taking advantage of many other riders. 

I was in New Orleans for a weekend trip with my girlfriend. We got to bourbon street and hung out until we called an Uber to get us back to our Airbnb. I designated a pickup and as I saw him pulling up, I waved my arm to acknowledge him. The driver punches the accelerator and drives right past me. I figure maybe he made some sort of mistake or couldn’t stop because traffic. I check my map and he’s a couple blocks away. I took several screenshots after I became wary of his behavior and to cover my ass if I needed to prove I was passed over. I give him 5 or so minutes to turn around the block or contact me. I message him in the mean time telling him he drove past me. After 10-15 min I tried calling him through the app a couple times. No answer. Another few minutes and the map updated and he was just as far away but in a different location. I message again, this time a little more assertively. Another 5 minutes I decided to call again one last time. I’m immediately sent to the automated message. He blocked me. Out of fear of paying the cancellation fee, I hung on while my girlfriend ordered us another ride. Til we got home I checked my app. My driver was in the same spot the whole time. He eventually canceled the ride himself in the middle of the night 4am or so. 

I’m speculating here, but I imagine this wasn’t his first time doing this. Especially with how many drunk people there are around bourbon street, I imagine many drunk people will cancel the ride after waiting for so long and possibly not think or remember about the fee. If this is the case, I don’t think this guy should continue driving. I’d like to give the benefit of the doubt to this driver, but his location not moving and blocking me from contacting him, only to eventually cancel on me several hours later makes me question his credibility.",Any action about an Uber driver “forcing” a cancellation?

1576802761,uber,"In early November, I signed up with multiple delivery apps - DoorDash, Instacart, Postmates, and UberEats.

I am here to tell you what an extremely poor experience I have had with Uber Support. I plan to drive 1 ½ hours next week to the nearest Uber Greenlight Hub to resolve an issue I have had for over a month. In this document, I will describe that issue and also how Uber Support has handled it.

When the background checks for the four apps I signed up with went out, there was a problem with all four - Checkr, the background check company, could not verify my social security number. For Instacart, DoorDash, and Postmates, all I had to do was call Checkr, explain the problem, and send them a picture of my Social Security card.

For UberEats, though, it wasn’t that simple. The Checkr support representative informed me the verification of my Social Security number had to be done by Uber itself, and they sent me a link to contact Uber to resolve it.

However, the Uber Support representative I spoke with did not understand this. They simply redirected me back to Checkr, giving me an almost robotic response, as if they did not even read my inquiry. I told them they misunderstood, and tried to explain what was going on in greater detail. No luck - they send me back the same response, word for word.

So I called up Checkr to tell them that Uber redirected me back to them. The representative seemed very confused and frustrated, saying that it’s Uber’s own policy to manually verify Social Security Numbers and that there was nothing he could do to help me, and that I could only keep trying to contact Uber Support.

But alas, I kept meeting with the same response, over, and over, and over again. The support representatives could not comprehend what I was saying; were they even reading my messages? Could they comprehend basic English? I had no idea.

Their message they loved to copy-and-paste is as follows: “After providing you with an opportunity to correct your SSN information in the Checkr applicant portal, Checkr remains unable to process your background check due to problems with the SSN you have supplied in your UBER account. Because we cannot obtain a complete background check, we are unable to partner with you.”

After reading that same message from 20 different support reps time and time again, those words sickened me. They frustrated me. I wanted to scream, it made no sense. There was no number to call, and the Twitter account for Uber Support was no help. They would just send me another support rep in-app that would send me the copy-pasted message they oh-so loved to send.

At one point, a certain support rep finally realized that sending me the same message wasn’t working out, so they simply said that a “specialized team” would reach out to me in 3-5 days.

It has been several weeks since that message. I continued asking them when they would contact me; some would revert to the good ole classic copypaste message, and some would tell me to hold out a bit longer. Well, i’m done holding out.

I’m driving to a whole different state tomorrow to speak to an actual human representative to fix this, because that’s what it takes to get your problem resolved when it’s with Uber.

It’s off peak hours mid-morning or mid-afternoon and all that’s changed is the frequency I use the route and not weather (well other than winter). Not a rant against drivers- just the pricing algorithm- instead of paying more for my ride, It’s far more likely I’m  going to buy an umbrella or wear an extra sweater and walk. Instead of “I’m running late- an Uber’s quick and only a few bucks” it’s “make sure to leave enough time to walk an Uber’s too expensive and only for emergencies”","I have a 15 minute walk to work, when I’m running late I’d use Uber for the 5 minute drive-at first it was $5, then when it became a habit it was $8 which was fine, now the algorithm wants $13- no special weather or rush"

Thank you for your good manners and thank you very very much for when you tip!

  
I have been a driver for various amounts of time off-and-on for a few years.  I am the type of person and in the type of situation where finding normal work is very difficult sometimes.  I don't wish for that.  I wish I could find a good fit and stay at a stable company for many years.  


However I have to accept my life as it is.  Uber has worked for me long-term because I don't have to ""report"" to anyone, the app is cool, and my passengers are very cool.  


Uber-ing days are chaos.  I never know how much I will make during a four- to twelve-hour shift.  I've seen times of desperation.  Yet my passengers have saved me so many times, I'm beginning to think very differently about the world.  I have had passengers give me large tips, just for doing my job well, and they are like literal angels in my life, saving me from the evil corporations and the suppressive society we are living in.

I entered it and it said $2 off first 3 rides. On the app and the invites page it clearly says first ride free and also for the person referring you. 
On the app though it says you'll get $5 for referaly. That's a big misleading but at least it says it. 
As for the $2 off I appreciate it but I've emailed them and also again recently providing screenshots that says first ride free etc and even on their own policy. 
I didn't ask for anything but I at least though they could follow up after. I emailed again saying I haven't heard back again for a while. I don't really care for a credit and it was more so that I emailed because my friend wants something out of it who referred me. I did it though to at least give them info they have contradicting stuff with the promo codes. Anyways I still appreciate the $2 off that I used. I haven't to used Uber since. My driver deserved 3 stars but I gave him 5 regardless. 

I'm wondering if I should hold a grudge against them for not responding to me least after I sent them all the info and screenshots and a follow up msg as well. I'm wondering if I should just leave it or just delete the account and app altogether or what?

I'm a traveling consultant and never rent a car. I fly to big cities and will uber to and from the airport / office using Uber black.

1576668790,uber,"Hi,

I currently live in Luton, UK. Before moving here, I lived in Bristol and had about 5 rides there, and the average rating there wasn't too bad, about 4.85. Since moving to Luton, my rating is constantly dropping. It's now 4.55 with 23 rides in total and I remember that 2 rides ago it was about 4.62 or something close to that. It's consistently dropping. Here is my usual routine:

I usually wait in front of the house before the Uber arrives, I never had him wait for me. I check the plates to make sure it's the car that I'm waiting for and then usually get either in the front seat or in the back placed diagonally to the driver ( I heard that sitting behind them might make them anxious so I avoid that ). I tell the driver my name if asked and never ask him his name because I know it's him based on the plates. Recently I've started to tell the drivers my name as soon as I get in as I've read on the internet that that's how you're supposed to do, but never knew this before. I try to greet him as politely as possible, then usually I'm becoming very quiet. I have Asperger's so socialising was never my thing. But I try to be polite and always answer when asked something. I never had any arguments of any sort. I usually keep my eyes on my smartphone and never make any requests, such as to change the music or open the windows. When the ride is done, I thank the driver and wish him a good day. I don't tip physical money as nowadays I do everything using my smartphone. I used to tip all the drivers through the app about 1 or 2 pounds for an average 7-8 pounds ride.

I have a few ideas what the problem might be, but I'm still unsure:

1. I don't tip physical money. I don't want to sound like the biggest jerk out here, but most of my drivers from Luton have Arabic names. I have no problem with that at all, but is it possible that they are a bit more old fashioned and expect me to tip physical money? Again, sorry if this is offending anyone.
2. They interpret my quiet personality as being racist and not wanting to speak to them? But even when I try to ask them how is their day, they seem to be quite irritated. Again I'm terrible at socialising but I try my best. Or maybe it's my accent?
3. Luton is not exactly a very nice city. There are many poor areas and I live in an area with a very good reputation. I am not rich though, I actually live in a house share. But unlike the central part of the city, where I live you mostly find white/British families. I really don't know about this, but it might be due to racial tension? Or what makes more sense to me is that they maybe expect a very generous physical tip from me?

Anyway, I might never know the true answer, but it really makes me feel unwelcome whenever I use Uber and I find myself trying to avoid it as much as possible. Also, it kind of pisses me off when other Uber drivers in this thread say that the rating is not due to the tips but rather due to : slamming doors, eating inside the car, not saying hello to the driver, being loud on the phone, entering the car through the right side just to next scoot over to the left, thus getting dirt off your feet to the back of the front chairs, bringing in obnoxious friends to ride along, etc. I never do any of the things in this list...

1576540278,uber,"So I work at the mall, our mall is very small and has two main entrances. I have taken a lot of Uber’s before- my passenger rating had always been 5.0. I normally go in. I like to believe I’m always in my best behavior in an Uber. I try to stay quiet, keep to myself, and respect the driver and their car. I talk here and there but normally I’m just heading into/off of work so I keep to myself. I’m not allowed to drive right now because I don’t have my license and when I can’t hitch a ride with my mom or my sister (we work at the same place, often enough the same shifts) I usually wait it out or call an Uber. 

So today, at about 5:00 PM, my mom said she would be an hour or so before being able to pick me up. I got off at 4:00 PM and decided to just take an Uber home. Our back hall leads outside right by one of the Mall’s main entrance which is between Dillard’s and JCPenny which is where I always put my stops and I’d never run into any issues or confusion with it before.

I’ll reference this entrance as entrance 1, and the other will be entrance 2. 

I saw that he was around the corner and he called me asking where I was at. I assumed he wasn’t from around here, as it’s a smaller town and most of my Uber drivers have been long term residents, so I told him I would walk around the corner and meet him up to make things easier rather than try to give him directions to where I was at. It’s the holidays, the parking lot is busy, our Mall’s layout is a little weird I suppose so, I figured it would be easier for the two of us.

I got inside, we exchanged a few words of small talk, “How are you?”, “I’m good and you?” Before he started driving. He was going around the other side of the mall, driving towards entrance 2. 

He tells me, “Next time, you need to put your pickup stop outside the main entrance.”

It caught me off guard but I had just assumed he wasn’t from here, I just said “Oh okay, there is a main entrance between JCPenny and Dillard’s if that helps, a lot of people don’t see it because it’s around the corner.” 

He parked his car in front of entrance 2, and his voice was raised almost to the point of yelling “Get the fuck out of my car.” I was so caught off guard and I didn’t know how to react. I just said “What?” And he repeated himself louder “Get the fuck out of my car!” 

I didn’t want any problems so I got out of his car, I got the cancellation notification and it charged me a fee. I disputed it through Uber and reported him but I’m left feeling very shaken and trying to wonder what I could have done better in that situation. 

I have had good experiences in Ubers and just generally uncomfortable experiences but I had never dealt with something like this before. I’m not sure if he was intoxicated or just in a bad mood.

The Uber driver who picked me up that day, and hopped out of the car to help me with my suitcase and was greeted with my immediate sobbing and asks to quickly leave the pick up point.  They graciously took my bag, told me to take a seat and we were on the way.  
I cried the entire ride and tried to briefly explain what had just happened, and they were considerate and managed to say all the right things.  
Didn't tell me step by step how to fix my problems, didn't tell me the typical ""well they're your family"" crap, they just told me to trust my heart, that know one knew me better than I did, and that it was okay if my heart was softer than others.

1573840938,uber,"TLDR: I took an Uber pool and the driver moved some of my things out of the trunk and left them behind when picking up a second passenger. This cost me $71 in round trip fares, wasted 5 hours of my time, and resulted in me not having my own car for a week. It has been 5 days, I've been trying to sort it out with Uber support via in-app ""help"", email, and twitter but have not received any useful help. How can I get in touch with someone at Uber who can resolve this?
*************
So for the long version:

My personal car has a bad wheel bearing that I want to replace before driving my car again. So I purchase the parts and tools I'll need and plan to do the repair this past Sunday. My car is parked at a friend's house about 40 minutes away from where I live, so I call an Uber pool to get there and do the repair. The Uber arrives, and I load my things into the trunk (two toolboxes, a case of parts, and my backpack).

During the ride, the driver picks up another passenger at a hotel. I am sitting in the back seat and hear the driver tell the other passenger he will load her two suitcases into the trunk, and put them behind my items since I will be dropped off first. The other passenger gets into the car, and the two of us wait in the car while the driver goes inside the hotel to use the bathroom.

When I finally get dropped off at my destination, I open the trunk to get my things out and find that the case of parts is no longer there. The driver comes back to investigate and tells me I had never brought that case with me, despite the fact that he somehow knew what color the case was. I ensure him that I did bring it with me, and that he must have left it at the hotel when rearranging items in the trunk. Eventually, the driver gives me his phone number and tells me he will drop the other passenger off and then go back to the hotel to look for my things and return them to me.

So I now have to wait at my car, unable to do anything since I no longer have the parts I need to do the repair that was the entire reason I took the Uber trip in the first place. During this time, I send some messages via the in-app ""help"" to explain the situation to Uber. After over an hour, I haven't heard from the driver so I call him, and he tells me that he did ***not*** go back to look for my belongings and tells me to not contact him again.

I have not heard from Uber support via the in-app ""help"" by this time, and I cannot find a phone number or email address. My plan was to have repaired my car and drive it home but, since the driver lost my parts, I now have to call *another* Uber to get home. Once I finally get home, I use Google Maps to find the hotel where the second passenger was picked up and call the hotel (luckily I had been paying enough attention to remember what the hotel looked like). I speak with hotel security and they tell me that, yes, they do have the case of my parts which was left on the curb outside the entrance.

I now call the Uber driver back and tell him that my items are at the hotel and that he can go pick them up from hotel security and return them to me. The driver still tries to claim that he is not at fault, and that the security guard must have taken my things out of his trunk while his car was parked there, but he finally agrees that he will pick up my belongings and return them to me. Almost an hour later, he arrives at my apartment but will not open the trunk to let me retrieve my belongings until I agree that I will give him a better rating in the Uber app.

All in all, this cost me $71 of Uber fares, wasted over 5 hours of my time, and resulted in me not being able to complete my car repair--so I now have no vehicle for the current week until I am able to do the repair this upcoming weekend. On top of that, the driver was rude and initially blamed me for the problem, claiming that I had not brought my items with me. Once I was able to prove that I had brought these items on the trip and they were left at the hotel, the driver then continued to try to avoid blame and say a security guard had taken my things out of his trunk. And when the driver finally brought my belongings back, he would not actually return them to me until I promised to give him a good rating in the Uber app.

I have communicated all of this information to Uber through the in-app ""help"", through email, and through their @Uber_support twitter. The twitter team keeps telling me that they want to help and promises that their email team will follow-up and help resolve the issue. This began last Sunday, it is now Friday. I got an email response on Tuesday informing me that Uber would look into the driver and giving me $3 of Uber credit as a ""courtesy."" I replied that this resolution was not satisfactory and have asked again for further help via app, email, and twitter but have not received any further customer support.

Is there some way to get in touch with a supervisor and get this resolved? Uber doesn't seem to care that their driver left my belongings behind and was then rude and did not attempt to fix the problem. At this point, I feel like I may have to request a chargeback on my credit card for the Uber fares, which I assume would result in my Uber account being closed.

1573803124,uber,"So I was checking how much a trip would cost from my house to the city centre. I accidentally clicked schedule. No big deal. I'll just cancel it. 

It was a big deal.

The trip was gone. I thought it was fine. No money from my account. Nothing. Then I get a message. ""I have arrived"". What the fuck? I go outside and there it is. My uber. I go to the driver and show him that I have cancelled the trip. But here's the thing. It didn't even come up in my recent trips. Or upcomming. I told him I had cancelled it and they probably just made a mistake. So he cancelled it and he left. Then i got another message. ""Searching for driver"". I couldn't cancel that. The trip wasn't showing up. So I went on to help to find a sollution. But as much as I looked. There wasn't one.

The next uber driver gave me the number for uber driver support and left. I called and explained my situatuon. And the operator said there was nothing they could do. This is exactly what I said. ""What am I meant to do then? Fucken I keep getting cars sent-"" and i got interrupted by a ""sir. We do not tolerate that kind of language on this line. If you continue then I will end the call"". Are you fucking 8? Jesus christ. I got pissed off. And I said. ""Ok sorry. But what am I meant to do?"" And again ""sir we will not tolerate this attitude"". Jesus fucking christ you keep sending cars to my house. Am I meant to be happy about this? So obviously this person was a child and couldn't handle my super duper very mean behaviour. So I hung up.

I kept going thru the help pages looking for a solution while sending uber drivers away. This went on for an hour. I had tried everything from completely restarting the app (clearing the cache and data) and to start a new trip. Nothing was working.

Until the last uber driver came. I told him what had happened. And he said. ""Try deactivating your account"". So I did. I deactivated it. And reactivated it. It seemingly worked. Until 15 minutes after I had logged back in saying ""we could not find any drivers near you"".

Ok. So even if I did deactivate it, they would've sent more cars if they could. Lovely app uber. Lovely customer support. 

The ride finally came up in my trips and said cancelled. Only due to not being able to find cars.

If you live in Toronto you know what has been happening with the weather. This morning  I left my house early and asked my dad to take me to the bus station (2 mins away) I had to catch the bus but the bus was delayed so I contacted to Uber ( this was my first ride with Uber ever). The estimated time was 8:10- max 8:31. I had an exam at 8:30 basically worth a lot of my grade. I told the driver to take an easier route and even guided him to take the route that would get me to class earlier. But no her really didn't listen on top of that kept telling me that being 5 mins late was no big deal ( because of him I was 12 or so mins late and had to run for 5 whole mins to class) , the fucker kept riding around the in and dropped me off at the most furthest point from my class. I begged him to take a diff route but he really did not want to listen . I have been going to this uni for 3 years and I know which routes are the most easiest how is this stupid ass shit not helping me out and then sending me a bill of 30 $ and Uber is not even giving me a discount for my first ride. Mind you that exam was only 35 mins long so yes I only got 23 mins to write 35 questions which I prepared so long and hard for.

1573482773,uber,"So when you're riding as a PAX (passenger) for uber (can't speak too much for lyft), you have the option to leave ratings, compliments, or speak directly to uber support if you feel something went wrong. The only problem with speaking with support, though, is confidentiality. Of course this protects both driver and rider from retribution from the other party. But this also means complaints about driving experience is anonymous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have driven over 1500 rides, 4.97 rating, have no malice towards pax at all- but friendly advice:

IF you have a complaint, let the driver know first. When you go directly to uber a few things happen:

They send us a support message about whatever the issue was

They do NOT tell us who said it 

They do NOT tell us when the ride occurred that lead to this issue

they do NOT give us a chance to explain.

Too many complaints and we get suspended without much chance for appeal.

For example- I've had 2 unsafe driving experiences reported in my entire driving time (1.5 years). I can guarantee that I do not drive recklessly, or do anything on purpose to endanger passengers (it is my own personal car after all and repairs are not cheap). Driving in Philly there are definetly some defensive maneuvers I have to take but I will always explain any jerky or unsettling driving that I HAVE to do to my pax's.

I don't say this because I think im at risk for deactivation. I am confident in my driving skills and customer service. But for those who rely on uber for more than just side money- a report that could be avoided by simply telling your driver ""Hey you are driving kind of fast"" or ""your turns are kind of sharp and they are making me uncomfortable"" could save someone else's source of income. And if the driver doesn't respond respectfully, then by all means report.

Experience:
3.5 years
4100 Uber 1200 Lyft
4.89 U 5.00 L

When I moved here in June I qualified for Pro and Gold pretty quickly. Because I was signed up in the Waco market instead of Dallas or Austin, the perk wasn’t offered.  The further gamification of the system was pretty fun and still sometimes continues to be when the iron is hot and there are $15 delivery surges in Boulder. The dangling of an ASU degree was nice too, since I technically had qualified when Pro first launched.

Having a Hub available was also pretty nice, not just with Uber, but also Lyft. Working in a small market, there wasn’t really any support other than phone support. Once a quarter, Uber would send reps down for a half day or so to recruit folks to drive Chip and Joanna fans around.

Since the launch of the Magnolia Silos, 60k+ people travel to Waco every week to see all the new pretty houses, beautiful Baylor and it’s kind boys and girls, and what happens when an old tragedy-stricken town hits it big in Hollywood and Houston/Dallas/Austin gentrify the shit out of it. #keepwacowacko

If I ever had a problem, both Uber and Lyft phone support were pretty sufficient. I didn’t always get the result i wanted, but I don’t remember ever having to wait more than 5 minutes to talk to an agent.

So when I got to Denver and activated gold within the first few weeks, I thought: nice, Priority Support. And a gold star. I feel so special.

But, boy, has that been a huge pile of gold, and now platinum covered shit.

My average wait time with phone support is 25 minutes. That’s to hear that annoying af diddy nonstop on speaker, fearing if I’m not there immediate when I finally talk to the innocent papa new guinean about how I just want to refund somebodies grandpa $12 because I waited for a scheduled ride at the nursing home for 21 minutes and he never showed. I was gonna take my 3.75 cancellation, but Uber malfunctioned and started the ride when I went to cancel, and then the poor older man was getting robbed $12.87 and paying me $6.24 for the fare. The 6.24 would have been decent, but not at the cost of some guy on Medicaid nearly 13 precious American monies.

Also, don’t ever try and navigate through them for roadside assistance. I had a blowout 7 miles from DIA once and had to pull over on the side of a mountainy hill on Peña with a 75 mph limit and 5 lanes. Uber allowed a driver to pick my passengers up so they could fly out of Denver, but I was stranded for an hour on the interstate, and they refused to send a driver because I was not a safe pickup point. 
I should’ve used my Progressive roadside, but wanted the whole ordeal on Uber’s dime, if nothing else to learn the process of navigating with support when there is a wreck or damage during a ride.
I waited 5 hours for a tow truck after I walked a mile to an exit, I got a Lyft to the closest chipotle, so I could shit my pants with company, after a stressful blowout situation (tire not butt, yet).

Tow driver was a real nice Vietnamese guy. He loaded my car up to take back to Boulder (I didn’t want to waste my spare tread when Uber would tow me home) and we had a nice chat. He’s been driving in the states for 30 years, mostly tow trucks and loves to go fishing with his dad. I only had $5 to tip, so I gave him my tiny yeti cooler I had brought to have my foodstuffs. It was like pulling teeth to get him to take it. Apparently those guys (and few ladies) never ever get tipped, since it’s usually handled through the insurance company and maybe people in that situation are too pissy to tip.

He rolled my car off at a tire shop, it was 6 pm on a Sunday at this point, so everything was closed.

Then as he was putting my spare on, he went ahead and did that in case I needed to go to a different tire shop the next morning, I get a call from my dad. Then after I decline that one get a call from my mom.
Once the tire was on and my friend from Vietnam was onto his next call, I checked my phone.

Ben, call me as soon as you can, I want you to say goodbye to Mimi. (My grandma)-Mom

So after a shitty day stuck on busy Peña for much of the day, and jumping through endless hoops attempting to get support to help bail me out of the tire blowout mess, this is gonna be the last time I get to say anything to my beloved Mimi, who was always the second closest thing to a mom besides, you know, my mom (❤️U🤱🏼y👩🏼‍🦳).

It wasn’t sudden, she had been declining, and I had gotten to talk to her the weekend before (my birthday was coming up and she wanted to know what to get. My grandpa was a frugle dentist that worked 55 years before he croaked, 3 days after his unplanned last day of work, so she was quite generous with the gifts. $2-300 minimum). But she couldn’t talk at this point. She had had lots of TIA mini strokes that never completely took away her speech, just her cognition slowly by slowly. 
I got to say my final words, she was in East Texas with my Aunts and Uncles and parents in the room. All the grandkids were calling in to say their goodbyes. It was damn holy and I’ll never forget it.

I called one of the few friends I’d made in Denver, and we ended up spending the whole night together drinking and playing the piano and taking about my grandmother, a person she didn’t know existed until about 5 weeks earlier when I first met this woman.

It was a wonderful night, life in the midst of death .

But, my grandma was still banging on deaths door, I had to get my tire replaced, and had to start planning how to get back to Texas. Should I fly, or should I drive.

I asked phone support if they’d comp any rides I had to take going to and from the tow shop. It took a whole day to replace the tire, tire shops are always slammed in DenverBoulder, which I didn’t mind that much, I didn’t really want to work.
But, I didn’t have a way to work without a vehicle that day.
Priority Support took about 1.5 hours to say no. Uber doesn’t work that way. It’s against policy, pay for your rides to the tow shop.

It was frustrating, but I had much bigger things on my mind. My grandmother didn’t die until Tuesday and this was Monday. 

I got a flight out Wednesday morning to sit shiva and hang with the family but did take the time to stop by the Uber hub on my way to the airport. I was going to rent through Uber/Hertz once I landed at DFW, which required a $20 from DFW to the quite unfortunate Pepboys in Irving that had a PopUp Hertz rental office in it. I wanted to ask a human in person if they could do anything about my unfortunate circumstances and maybe at least comp some rides I had to take. 
Again; sorry that’s against our policy.

Whatever. I hadn’t slept the night before, I had planned to drive the 15+hours the next morning but it had been a long few days and I wasn’t getting zzz’s. I actually bought my Southwest ticket at 6 am for a 12 pm departure and was able to sleep 45 minutes once that stress was taken away.

My flight was delayed slightly and I was a little worried I might not make it to Hertz in time. I had planned for a 5pm pickup. I texted my dad, he googled the pepboys, which was open until 6, but had not seen Hertz actually closes at 5 while the rest of the store remains open another 60 minutes.

I rolled out of DFW at 4:30 with a Uber driver who was a nice Oak Cliff gentlemen who had the best maintained leather I had ever seen in his 300. He even left the cleaner out in the back so you could notice his dedication and pride. We had a nice chat, and I realized why I had left Texas after 32 years after my humid sweats and salted his leather up a bit. The almost constant 11% humidity in Denver had opened my whole life to a new way of living. 

I stroll into Hertz at 5:10 and I get a sorry, we’re closed.

Uhhh, the website says 6.
-We close at 5, its rare I’m even here this late (now 11 mins after closing time)

But my dad checked and it said 6

What about Cash app, will that work.
-It should be cash, but you can do it, I’ll need more.

It finally worked. She took the Paul Card, and rented me the shittiest Elantra I’ve ever been in. It had 94000 miles.

Whatever, the bribe was awful, I thought maybe I wouldn’t have to do more than just leave her a $20 tip at the end of it, but ultimately I gave her $20 cash and $75 venmo to the number she gave me.

I make it to my grandmas house where my parents and I always stay and where I’ve spent all 32 of my Christmases and most Easters.
It’s a wonderful time with family, I get to see a lot of old and new faces, we bury the matriarch well.

I may include a photo or 2 at the end as long as the kooky few of you promise not to doxx me. 

As I go to start the car up, it’s now Sunday, we buried Joyce on Saturday, we notice the car is leaking oil bad. It does a number to this now vacant house that housed my mother, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, and my father and I for 60 years. It was the childhood home for my mom and uncles, and barely the second home my grandparents had ever owned. They grew up poor af in Camden and Wheatley Arkansas through the depression and my grandpa got to go to dental school at Washington University in St. Louis. He practiced 50+ years in Henderson, Texas.

Sure, it could be sandblasted, but goddamn Uber, goddamn Hertz. You folks were some reaaaal a-holes, and not in the Gaurdians of the Galaxy type of way.

I tried to change the car out back in Irving, they said they didn’t have any cars and to try another Hertz.
I called all in the DFW area and none said they had cars available. Keep trying. 
So I drive back to Waco, and of course, why would I have ever doubted...Hertz in Waco, was magnificent.

The very kind young man got me in a Chrysler 300, leather seats of my own now, and even a sunroof!

I rolled outta ACT airport feeling alright again. I was gonna spend another week or so in Waco catching up with old college pals and friends I’d made over the course of 14 years.

But as I went to switch the car over through Uber Priority Support, I was informed my Chrysler was not gonna cut it. Even though it was a 2018 and had only 20k miles, it wasn’t TNC certified and therefore couldn’t be operated on either the Lyft of Uber app. (This one was a good 2 wasted hours of wrestling with “Priority Support”)
Their solution: go to Austin or Dallas to a Hub and they’ll sort you out.

I add Austin to my itinerary to avoid having to mess with Dallas again and head down on a Saturday morning. Big mistake, should have gone on Friday.
The Hub is open, but they can’t help me. They can’t upload a rental to the platform that isn’t TNC certified. They say go back to UberHertz, again in a pepboys, but they’re not open until Monday.

Wow, what an experienced. This. Is. Never. Ending.

So, I said fuck it, I’ll call every rider I get and explain the situation far more briefly than I have here, and just ask for forgiveness if anyone reports me for showing up in the wrong ride.
This worked mostly well. Austin of course didn’t give a shit, neither did Waco, but I did have one guy report me in Dallas when I finally made it back north in the days preceding my trip back to my new home, an assortment of airBnBs in Arvada, Denver, and Aurora. I got the threatening algorithm message that said this could be a cause for deactivation, so made the mistake of calling support again to give em another earfull for their assholerey.

I made it back to Denver, tried the Hub once more for any assistance, but didn’t get anything more than a little bit of sympathy and a sorry.
I realize I’m not Titan like some of you that have cleared 20k rides, but I did think 3+ years with the company would at least get me a few Uber rides comped. I was wrong.

Uber post IPO is awful. I know Travis was a piece of buffalo shit but a lot of things were better then. You know, like when we got 75% of the fare.

Oh well, guess I’ll head over to r/lyft...

Ohmahgoooood, well. Lyft is worse. Way worse. Check it out. Or drive for Favor if you’re in Texas. And leave these jokers behind if they keep treating us like Thomas Wayne would.

1573449798,uber,"Got a notification today from Uber that I was riding around Texas/Louisiana, tipping the same driver 80$ for 30$ drives. Immediately canceled the current ride, called Uber safety line. Guy on the phone seemed like they were trying to contact the police/driver. Then told me I'd be receiving a phone call from them within a few minutes, and the charges will be dropped

An hour later credit card fraud line called, they locked the card on their end, but it wasn't due to Uber making anything happen. As I hung up with them when I was busy changing my passwords noticed a Russian email from Uber for ANOTHER ride from the same street the guy was on when I canceled, trying to go to the same fucking casino.

Problem is the Uber has my PayPal/Bank card as well. And I changed my password on my account, but it hasn't logged out anywhere. Even have 2 step authentication. But the fucker is still logged on his device.

I made a second call to Uber where the lady pretended to not hear me, and hung up (this is the safety hotline by the way). 3rd call, and the lady starts going off on me for calling their safety hotline for fraud. Explained to her that it's the only way to get through to a live person, and someone is currently commiting fraud in the back seat of one of Ubers driver's, or the driver is. That constitutes as a non immediate danger which could be solved by Uber calling the police. I'm sitting here watching the GPS of this guy as he's going.

Was told I'll be ""contacted"" in the next few weeks, they don't have the ability to close, or lock my account, contact their driver, or law enforcement. Now my ride history is coming up as all blank on the app. I've got the entire thing screen shotted though, and the credit card fraud Dept said this is an ongoing issue with Uber. What's suspicious about it is it's the same driver for every ride, and he's getting ripped 80-100$ for rides under 20$. Looked up the pickup addresses, and reported them to the local law enforcement with the names/addresses.

This stinks... I'm completely assuming here, but I believe they have some drivers who are doing some sketch shit, and they're trying to deal with it internally. Had a ride a couple weeks ago where my driver was involved in some kind of sketchy deal. Pulled into a used cellphone shop went in with a gym bag he grabbed from his trunk, left me in the car for 10-15 minutes, and came back, pulled a tan shipping envelope out of his jacket, and locked it in the glove box. His excuse was he needed to go to the bathroom. He also left me in his locked car with child safety locks on it.

 Get a call from Diamond! I was excited because it's usually one of the ladies of the night or maybe the strip club! They always tip $20.00, even on a bad night they still give you a $3 tip! I get there and it turns out not to be any of my regular ladies.   

It was 3 beautiful ladies, they were dressed in African attire, looking so beautiful, so many different colors of the rainbow, yellow, red, maroon, burgundy. One of them I could tell had a slight hump back and walked with a limp. I felt bad for her right away because people with disabilities work extra hard. 

 As they got into my car, I noticed that the lady with the humpback wasn't getting into the car correctly. She was literally leaning all the way over but for some reason couldn't put her knees up, I thought maybe it was due to her disability.  

 They all got in, one in the front and the other two in the back, then I asked them their names and ask them to all click their seatbelts. The lady with the hump on her back didn't move. I turned around and I told her ""you are precious cargo, I must make sure I get you there in one piece please click your seatbelt"".   

She had a little waist so I knew it would be no problem to bring that belt down and bring it across your waist. She looked at me funny.   

At that moment she grabbed the cloth of her dress and pulled it around and her hump on her back moved to her side but as it moved to her side it also started kicking! Right at that moment I thought to myself WTF! She had a baby wrapped up in her dress!   


 I looked at her and said ""lady your hump is moving viciously and has moved to the side of your underarm! The lady in the front giggled!  

 At that moment I asked the ladies did they have a car seat for the baby! All three of them shook their heads no in unison. I asked them to please step out of the car and that I could not take them with a baby with no car seat.   

As they were climbing out of the car and I was letting the timer run out I started laughing hysterically and I couldn't stop.

 I got a message while I was waiting it was the lady asking me to hurry up and cancel the ride so that she could call another car right away because I was holding her up.

1570728303,uber,"Last week between the hours of 2-3 AM I had an encounter with a man I believed to be my uber driver. As an honest disclaimer, I was heavily under the influence of alcohol (not blacked out but enough for things to be foggy) so I am afraid I cannot recount the facts perfectly. From what I remember, I got in the car and the man made me feel very uncomfortable. I remember looking down to see that my trip had been cancelled and him touching the inside of my thigh suggestively, which prompted to me to immediately exit the vehicle and file a report with uber. Fortunately police were nearby and saw that I was distressed. They had me file a police report.

At the time, I was near certain the driver of that car was the uber I had called. When I compared his picture on my phone to what I remembered of the driver's appearance I believed them to be the same man. However, I am fearful that due to intoxication I could have been drawing similarities between general features of the driver in the picture and the man responsible for this incident - and I made this clear to the police. 

While it could be the case that the driver I reported to uber is the man responsible for this incident and cancelled my trip while I was in the car, there is also a possibility that it was an unaffiliated driver who misled me to believe that he was my uber driver. I am very aware of the repercussions of making a false-report (even one made in good faith) and would not want an honest driver to be suspended on my behalf. Given this, I am uncertain on how to proceed. There is a chance the driver I reported is the man responsible for the incident but also a chance that it could have been someone else. I certainly would not want a true uber driver to get away with something like this but I also would not want an innocent man to lose his livelihood whether it be temporary or permanent.

I already followed up my original report to both uber and the police stating these very same concerns. But I would appreciate any input or suggestions. The difficulty here is rooted in my intoxication. When sober, I would have always made sure the the license plate matches what's listed on the app but I just can't remember if that were the case and therefore I am uncertain who is responsible. The situation is very unsettling but I would never want to make accusations against an innocent person because my thought-process at the time and memories now were clouded by alcohol.

1570721264,uber,"TL;DR: Uber malfunctions, overcharges me, and refuses to take responsibility and refund my evidence based claim by circumventing the issue for 9 days and counting now. 0 support. 0 integrity. Absolutely despicable malpractice.
------
Ive had multiple issues with Uber overcharging my account over the years. This one takes the cake. This is the final fucking straw. 

Its been NINE days now that I have not been refunded.

I have reached out multiple times a day with verifiably legitimate explanations, as well as picture evidence of my bank statements and Uber account. 

For NINE days I am ignored, or the issue is circumvented with the same scripted BS replies.

For a public company that people are supposed to trust with their bank information, this is some of the most disgusting misconduct ive ever dealt with. 

The fact that an issue pertaining to someone being outright ripped off due to a malfunction has been dragged on for 9 days, and not even prioritized to the extent of atleast being replied to quicker than every 20 hours is literally breaking my mind right now. 

Because I used Visa Debit, my bank cant even do anything. 

After this, I would honestly rather go back to taxi fares or try Lyft. If Uber can arbitrarily charge your account and withhold funds, and then make you jump through hoops for 9 days and counting, is the extra $10 or so really that much of a difference using a taxi? 

Atleast there is some sort of peace of mind that the cab driver cant just reach into your pocket because (s)he decides (s)he wants more money.

I am fucking exhausted and extremely inconvenienced that Ive been made to deal with getting my own money back for 9 days now. 

This seems to be a recurring theme lately when I go to check reviews. It seems that theyve always had a problem with overcharging. The only difference is that now the policy seems to be circumvent circumvent circumvent until the patron is exhausted or forgets. 

I fucking hate Uber with all of my heart and I hope that this shit catches up with them and the company fucking tanks into oblivion and everyone is arrested/sentenced to capital punishment.

I hate people who insist on riding in the front seat. I keep a backpack and stuff on the seat to make it obvious. I pull up so the rider is at the rear door.

But Indian men, WTF is your deal? Seriously! No disrespect. 9/10 times you’re awesome people who are great riders. But what is it with the insistence on the front seat?

So I asked a drunk Indian guy why he insists on sitting in the front. He said it’s because of the caste system. That Indian dudes ride in the front to “prove” that they don’t think they are better than you.

Now I had to get a second Uber to take me to the correct location which cost me just as much.

When I got there I contacted Uber to explain the issue. They apologized and said that they would credit my account $3. I told them that wasn't good enough because I had to get a second Uber which cost me just much and I asked for a refund for the first one, to which they told me that it's not in their policy to give refunds. Excuse me, what?? I'd think that if a company took someone to some random location, kicked them out, and stranded them there that they'd be bending over backwards to make it right, but they won't even do the bare minimum of giving me back my money? 

I know there are a lot of drivers here on this sub and I've seen stories of people saying that passengers would complain about something that didn't happen, and then the driver didn't get paid for that trip. But then where is the money going if Uber isn't refunding the passenger? Just seems really strange to me. Is this normal for Uber? I think I will probably just issue a charge back on my credit card for the first trip and forget about using Uber ever again.","Uber driver took me to the wrong location, Uber says that they don't give refunds?"

# Lyft/Uber offering free rides to/from Hurricane evacuation shelters... screw driver safety

📷 

I  swear these kale smoothie chugging P R dorks never cease to amaze. $20  discounted rides. Imagine toting multiple pax with pets,pillows, food,  water, luggage, precious mementos, etc. to an evacuation center with a  traffic jam at the drop off. By the way no storm surge for drivers ( pun  intended). They will ""tip in the app"". SMFH",Lyft/Uber offering free rides to/from Hurricane evacuation shelters... screw driver safety
1567434897,uber,"I opened the passenger app one morning to request an uber, and noticed that 2 were about 4 blocks away from me, coming down my street. I looked outside, waited, and after a minute, the 2 cars passed by my house (on the app). Never did 2 actual cars drive by. I waited for about a minute, thinking the app may be slow, but nothing.

1567394041,uber,"Hello everyone , I have been driving Uber in the Maryland area ( stay out of Baltimore ) for the past year. I have about 900 trips under my belt with a 4.94 rating. I tend to stay in the counties outside of Baltimore to do my best to avoid troublesome pax, which results in longer fares which I enjoy. When I first started , As many freshmen would , I would accept every ping I received. Fast forward a few months and no major incidents have happened but I have learned to never accept anything lower than 4.80. Recently About a month or so ago I picked up a passenger who acted like no passenger I have had before. She got into my car , did not respond to my “ hey, how are you today “ and threw her bag into my car. Not ever dealing with something like this before I foolishly started the ride and drove for about a mile before my I could feel my anxiety building to a boiling point , having picked up such a scumbag of a passenger. I inform the girl and her boyfriend that I am canceling the ride and bringing them back home. Once I drive them back a mile to their house , they refuse to leave my car until they see that the money is returned into their Uber account for the ride. When they refuse to leave my car , I take the keys and call the police outside. They send a car and they get out just before the police arrive. After that incident , I became so cautious of who I pick up. I always keep all my doors locked , when the passenger get in my car I wait to say hello and make sure they respond respectfully before I start the trip , or I will have no problem saying “ get the fuck out of my car you arrogant prick” to the next passenger who tries to disrespect a driver by completely ignoring their hello. It has gotten to the point no where I almost get anxiety attacks the closer I get a pax , ever since that terrible experience.

So once we figure out which lot the car is at, we hopped in an uber to collect our car. For context, we live in Los Angeles and the 20-minute drive to the lot did require some freeway driving.

We get into a minivan and our driver is a rather senior Asian guy wearing big women's sunglasses, and reeking of mothballs. You know the type. As we set off he asks me if he should go up the hill on our street, as the visible map on his phone is directing him to do. I'm like, um yeah, go on ahead. The first bit of our drive is rather uneventful but as we got closer and closer to the freeway onramp, he was 3 lanes over from where he needed to be. My husband alerted him to the fact and he moved over. No biggie really, he may not be familiar with the area. Then on the freeway he settles into the far left lane (of 5 lanes) at a pace of 60 miles per hour. People are getting annoyed and passing him constantly.

We start nearing our exit and he doesn't move over to the right where he needs to be to exit. The map clearly shows our exit is coming up. We get to the point where the exit is visible maybe 10 car lengths ahead of us and he starts slowing down like crazy. This man came to a FULL STOP in the fast lane of an LA freeway and then cut across 5 lanes of traffic with no blinker on and barely snuck in the last possible point he could make the exit at. Cars swerved around us, honked like crazy and, slammed on the breaks to avoid hitting us. It was a fucking miracle we didn't get in an accident. The next 5 turns/lane changes on the journey were all done at the last minute with no blinker, sometimes changing lanes mid intersection.

Not using uber very much I was nervous for what to expect on my trip to LA, but knowing my personality had no fear. Each driver was great. I made conversation with all, laughed with most, and my score and ego got a little higher that, oh yes me? I am *that* 4.95 bitch. 

Thinking my worries regarding my uber experiences were dumbfounded and no longer, by the time I ordered my uber from my company to LAX (brought bags with moi to work), I didn’t think twice about being afraid of the driver pulling up. 

I usually get in the back seat just out of respect for most drivers who don’t like to chit chat much and would rather me move along. So I continued as so. 
As soon as I got in the back and he welcomed me, he said he *hates* when people get in the back seat and wants me to come in the passenger seat. 

Hmmm, ok. 
I do so. 

The ride continues on with him asking questions about where I am from, why I am here and honestly, I didn’t give a hoot about sharing (naivety). He ended up telling me he disliked the women of LA because of “how skinny they are” (mind you not, I was a good 110 pounds at this point and eating everyday like a prepubescent male). 

I thought I was out of the clear. *whew not his type* is exactly what I thought. My attention then was abruptly zoomed into him as soon as he starting explaining he likes bigger women because his mom was bigger...and that...he fantasized about her. 

Keeping it together, I simply try to nod it off as normal and give some half ass psych major evaluation of Freudian interpretations of his fantasy regarding his own mother. *jesus christ*.

By the time we arrived to LAX I thought his confessions and niches were all out, but as we were pulling in he starts telling me he knew when he liked older women from an early age. Once again, I felt in the clear since I am a younger female and clearly his liking is toward motherly figures. 

He goes on to tell me right as he’s taking my bags out “I was five, and my teacher had wonderful, beautiful feet and I would just stare at them and that’s when I knew”. AND LOOKS DOWN AT MY LITTLE BIRKENSTOCK WEARING FEET. I just laughed and said “ohhh, hahah” and awkwardly thanked him for the ride.

Sincerely, I know myself, I know I'm not a sensual youthful girl or that I do not always give tips, nevertheless when my Uber arrives I am already showered and ready to pick it up alone, I sit behind the copilot's seat, I always say ""Hi!"" and how is his day going, then we proceed, I never eat into de car (I do not even do it in mine), I am just really respectful with the space, during the journey 100% of the times I reply emails as it is one of my few free times during the day also considering I'm a relly silent person so I do not like talking just to socialize, I'm comfortable like that and my phone is just silent, when we arrive I say ""thanks"", I never slap the door and then I only grade with 5 stars and a good compliment depending on how I perceived the trip.

1564598542,uber,"Hi guys this is my feedback I sent to Uber. Let me know what do you think, if you have similar concerns or if you want to know more about my story.

Hi there, I have a ongoing dispute with a Driver who refuse to return a lost item. This advice is closely related to that dispute. Please check your record for further information. I have mentioned my feedbacks on community guidelines on Uber app support, but i would like to keep a record here too. 

In my case, since Uber already disclaimed responsibility for itself and drivers, I cannot successfully file a criminal litigation through the prosecutor in Ohio, and since it is a misdemeanor case there will likely be no follow ups from police to my police report i filed in Cleveland, while the overall cost of civil litigation in small claim court is higher than the value of the lost item for me. The current reality is raiders are likely have no effective mean to reclaim a small value lost item if the driver refuse to return it. 


Furthermore, some drivers might see return a lost item as optional when there is no clear community guideline. My driver very clearly told me that he think he is free to decide whether to return it, keep it or seIl it even after two months and my repeated complaints on Uber app support. In order to fundamentally prevent further incidents like mine from happening again, I highly recommend Uber revise its community guideline and clearly state any lost item should be returned within reasonable amount of time when a owner is known and actively pursuing its return( typically a week or two maybe?). Fortunately in my case the value of my lost item is not significant, but for others it might be life altering. I hope Uber can recognize the serious and urgent need to add a detailed lost and found policy in community guideline.",My feedback on Uber lost and found policy

He is standing in front of the house with the number behind him.

He had a paper cup of coffee in his hand.

He turned down my offer to put his hand-carry into the trunk. He dragged the metal framed thing into the back seat, bumping off everything.

He started giving directions before I drove off. He told me to get into carpool lane and get out of it before I manage to. And many things in between.

He was on the phone too; I can't tell if he was talking to me or the phone. 

I was very surprised that he didn't tell me the airline before I asked.

He asked me to stay on the left lane; I thought he was going to the car park. Then abruptly he told me to turn right into the airlines unloading zone where everybody goes.

The saving grace is that he took the coffee cup (as if to eliminate the possibility that I charge him the cleaning fee).

HB also has numerous bars but there are only 2 designated pickup points. So if you keep doing what you do, you can be as good as landing on the no ride list even if you have decent ratings.

On the driver app, tap on the trip. Tap on ?. Tap on ""My rider was rude"". For anything else, scroll down to trip issues, tap on ""issue with a rider"". Pick one including ""unsafe', ""made a mess"". 

After selecting the problem, enter a little bit of detail using a combination of custom canned responses on your mobile keyboard. Include a canned unpair request, and submit. It takes about 2 minutes from our South Asia colleagues to complete the unpairing and notify you on the driver app. It is one of the few things they are fully authorized to do and thoroughly competent to do.

Drivers don't need to rate in order to unpair so riders have no advance warnings. Better still, it doesn't matter if the trip is canceled, and it doesn't matter who canceled it.

For example, if you drive in the backup, it makes me unsafe, asking me to maneuver without sufficient time. And distract me from reading the traffic conditions and signals.

If you see that the timer starts, don't call me and say I'm not at the pin. That will be rude. If you cannot come on time I will cancel and collect the cancellation fee.

I sent them pictures of me from that day so they could compare to the person in this alleged (I have not seen it) video and confirm it isn't me in the video.

They told me the video showed a person kicking the driver in the ribs and him begging them to stop saying ""I just had surgery there"". I've never kicked a person in my life, never touched an uber driver, never had any incident like this. I am a non-violent person and have never had a physical altercation of any kind in my life.

I remember a while back we ordered food on uber eats and received the wrong meal entirely. Uber refunded that portion of the meal without hesitation. Since then, I have probably ordered ~15 times over the years and I have never complained since then until tonight, so it's not like I'm some serial complainer always looking for a free meal. Pretty disappointed that after the money we spent using uber instead of just going to the restaurant, there is no recourse if you wind up getting shitty food.",Is there no longer any recourse on bad food being delivered via uber eats?

I was hit from behind while on an active Uber drive in Los Angeles with a passenger. In addition to my crushed personal car, I also suffered extensive spinal injuries. The driver who hit me, BTW, was an unlicensed, uninsured 16-year-old girl who was joyriding her elderly grandfather's car. Obviously, I retained a PI attorney who filed a claim against James River and their $1M uninsured motorist policy, and had to beg and borrow to come up with the $1K deductible, even though the other driver was 100% at-fault. If I had an extra thousand bucks lying around, why would I being doing this crappy job in the first place?

But today, I also contacted an attorney friend who happens to be one of the most prominent Workers Comp attorneys in Los Angeles, thinking I had no case as Uber defines its drivers as ""independent contractors"" without Workers Comp benefits. He assured me, without any qualifiers, that, under current CA law, Uber drivers are classified as ""employees"" by the state Workers Comp Board, regardless of what Uber professes to the contrary.

He could not wait to set up a meeting with me Monday morning to do client intake and file a WC case against Uber's deep pockets, and I strongly encourage other Uber drivers injured on the job to consult with Workers Comp attorneys to see if they get similar responses. Your injuries do not even have to be the result of an accident, you could trip while exiting your car, or suffer back pain from too many hours driving--any medical issue you experience while on the job would qualify, whether or not you are on an active trip.

Why do you think Uber and Lyft have lobbied their drivers in California so hard to reach out to their representatives to repeal the Dynamex decision? It's certainly not for the drivers' benefit--it is because reclassifying drivers as employees exponentially increases their financial exposure. The rideshare companies can define us anyway they like, but the CA Workers Comp board apparently has a different definition, and they are the ones with the power to levy meaningful financial sanctions.

When you drive for Uber/Lyft, your are strongly (encouraged) to drive during specific times when boosts and bonuses apply, you are not given information about the destination of the trip you accept beforehand and, most importantly, your are penalized by both platforms when your acceptance percentage or cancellation rates fall below a certain level.

On May 31st, I accepted the ride pass price for my ride, the same price I pay every morning and the drivers app malfunctioned. He told me he couldn't see my destination and asked me for my address, yet he still drove me to the wrong location. He corrected himself and then drove me to the correct location. Then he ended the ride.

&amp;#x200B;

I was given a completely different and much higher charge than the one I accepted. Customer service refused to correct my charge to the one I was given upfront. They gave me a small discount for the additional ""stop"" and then ignored the fact that I have a ride pass, which I paid for and agreed to the terms of.

&amp;#x200B;

Every attempt to speak to customer service since has ended with ""this is the correct price or we are not going to honor your ride pass, next time make sure it was applied.""

&amp;#x200B;

It was applied. I saw it was applied and accepted the ride pass price. The uber driver's app failed. It told me we were driving to somewhere in the ocean off of Ghana. I have screenshots to prove the error. I also have proof of my ride pass and proof that the price is the same every day for the same exact ride I've been doing daily for two years.

1561475205,uber,"I never post but I want to make a point here. Tipping started during prohibition to keep restaurants operating without alcohol sales. It is entirely based on the idea of below minimum wage pay subsidized by tips to at least equal minimum wage. 

Recently, America has seen this problem where companies are encouraging consumers to tip in every situation available. Cashier only taking my order?  Tip please. **This is an example of transferring more cost to the consumer**.  

I’m sure most drivers make inflation-adjusted minimum wage of 15$ an hour. Therefore tips are not necessary. 

Companies have weaponized social pressure to transfer cost to consumers. We have been put against each other, when it’s the companies we should be angry with. 

Servers get tipped because they make 2.13 an hour. This is the only situation where tipping is necessary. 

People’s greed and ignorance are why we’re in this situation in the first place. You want to make more money?  Be nicer  Tips are not mandatory. It’s your companies job to pay you, not the customer.

1561474088,uber,"Yesterday I was taking an Uber back from the airport. I tipped the driver $10 cash, which is what I typically tip, but wanted to throw him a couple extra bucks as well for helping me with my bags. However, I didn’t have any small bills, so I figured I’d add it in the app (in addition to the cash I gave him.) So I figured $2 for a large bag, $1 for a small one, same as I’d give a porter, and tipped $3 in the app. A few minutes later, I checked and it did not go through. I figured I made an error and added the tip again. I checked a few minutes later and it still was not listed, nor was I charged, so I added it a third time. It still was not listed, so I reached out to uber support, who were able to put it through and make sure it only went through once. 

I’m guessing most riders aren’t as diligent as I am and wouldn’t follow up t make sure their tip actually went through. And even if the app tip didn’t go through, the driver still got a nice tip in cash. Most people probably wouldn’t tip cash AND in the app (nor would I in most circumstances).

I called her thinking maybe her car wasnt moving because she was stuck in traffic or got into an accident, and then she told me she’s been waiting outside for 10 minutes trying to call me, but the app never showed her calls either.

She then proceeded to tell me her app has been acting up and won’t load her map correctly either when she’s driving, and was generally lagging and or frozen so it seems that the tech issue might have fallen heavily on her phone/internet connection perhaps than mine. She still drove me, although she seemed aggravated and initially seemed to be trying to pit the blame on me regaurdless of the fact that she’s the one whose been having the issues previously.

So I parked at the pin, probably at the opposite side of the road across the yellow curbs. Can't get into the long line on the other side but easy parking on my side.

No worries, at that time the area is well protected by a fleet of some 20 police SUV's circulating around. I did message the pax and gave them plenty of time to reply within the wait time.

This post is to illustrate an example on how driver’s and passengers are actually on the same team. 

I’ll get right to the point. 

The following screenshots are from surge at SFO.

This is what we [see](https://imgur.com/a/wxtaWZy).

This is what you [see](https://imgur.com/a/33ggrda).

Bear in mind that a ride from SFO to Fort Mason is around 32 bucks, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/3vJbEsH). Drivers make about 19 dollars from that 32 dollar fare. $5 of that fare goes to SFO, which means we make 19 and Lyft makes 8. Depending on the driver, our commission is supposed to be 20 to 25 percent. In this example, it’s about 30 percent.

Ask yourself, why are you paying nearly double (93 percent more in this example), when the driver only gets $5.50 of it? Well, our surge is flat now, which means we get that amount no matter where you go.

Here is a screenshot ten minutes or so later, when the surge has gone down from $5.50 to $2.25.

What we [see](https://imgur.com/a/1UOnQy7).

What you [see](https://imgur.com/a/j3uPWnf).

Wait, what??

All of sudden, our surge earnings have cut in half, from $5.50 to $2.25, a difference of $3.25.

Meanwhile, what you pay goes down from $58.18 to $36.90, a difference of $21.28.

So what does this mean? 

It means Uber is shortchanging the drivers. They’re charging true surge multiplier pricing, and only giving the drivers a few dollars in this example.

You might be saying to yourself, “what the driver makes has nothing to with me.” While it’s true that there isn’t a correlation between what you pay and what we earn, I’ll give you the kicker: they are short changing drivers, while charging YOU, THE PASSENGER, ridiculous fares. In the end, WE BOTH GET SCREWED OVER. This is how Uber/Lyft is going to turn a profit! Wake up!

Like I said from the beginning, drivers and passengers are on the same team. They don’t care about either of us. At the end of the day, they are out to protect their bottom line.

1558650139,uber,"My son's world changed at 17 when he got dx with a severe form of epilepsy.  We tried to plan for how his future would work for college and career without being able to drive. 

We live in a landlocked area and uber is just starting up and is pretty minimal. I wanted my son to gain some confidence that independence was possible so I let him go on a road trip with a close friend to CA to an event. He stayed with family in a residential neighborhood. Parking was $40-50 at the event center so he tried uber for the first time. He was requesting a ride from a home to go to the event center (about 8 miles away). No one accepted his request. We wondered if he did something wrong? I checked the account, I had a valid credit card , everything seemed fine. A neighbor finally gave him a ride because he waited over 45 minutes for an uber at 10am in a LA suburb. Then he tried to get a ride back from the event center (which was in LA) at 9pm and again no one accepted his ride request. Someone else requested an uber for him( a person that uses uber all the time) and the uber came so there were drivers in the area and they were willing to take him back to the house, but just not when he requested. The experienced rider, said they thought my son was doing everything right, but was just not getting anyone to accept his ride. 

Is it because he has never used the service that people don't accept it? Is there something he is doing wrong? He is starting college in a few months and I want to get him feeling okay that he will be able to get around on his own and buses do not go everywhere and taxis are harder to find. Should I be finding a close city that has uber and drop him off somewhere and have him try again and if he works will he have a rating? and maybe it will work better in a big city?

1558638461,uber,"Hello all,

I'm a fairly new Uber user who has had only five trips in the space of 1-2 months. Each of my trips have been in the cost range of £11-£13 and I've included a tip in each one with 5 stars. 

However my passenger rating is 4.60 which has honestly confused me to no end.  

All of my trips are from work to home on a Saturday, so I'm dressed smart, I've conversed with drivers about their days, said thank you &amp; never rude or slam doors. 

I've had one driver who I didn't speak much to and he drove like a lunatic overtaking cars but I never commented and simply looked out of the window with the odd bit of conversation. Is there any reason why my rating could be low? It is truthfully worrying me as I'm needing to get a longer trip later next month and I'm a tad worried I won't be able to get a driver.",Possible reasons why my passenger rating is 4.60 after only five trips?

1558630822,uber,"Uber is between a rock and a hard place.  It has to please drivers and go easy on passengers at the same time, which is a hard thing to do.  The real killer of our surge isn't Uber, it is actually the real estate and rental industry.  Most young people have to live 3 people or more in 1 or 2 bedrooms in areas that are popular like Uptown or Downtown or maybe live with their parents if they are lucky.","Man now that I gave it deep thought, and after driving tons of people.

1558629186,uber,"The other day I took an Uber pretty late at night back from a friend's house, and somewhere during the trip my phone slipped out of my pocket. I realized I had lost it the next morning, and used Uber's ""contact driver about a lost item"" feature on their website to try and let them know that I had forgotten my phone, but heard a message on the other side that said something along the lines of ""the person you are trying to reach is unavailable, please try again later."" I figured maybe they weren't awake or were busy at the time, but I wasn't given the chance to leave a message which was sort of weird. I tried calling numerous times throughout the day up until around 11:30 PM (rude, I know, but I was desperate at that point), and every single time I got the same recording from the other side. For clarification, this wasn't his voicemail recording, but one of the generic messages that depending on a number of circumstances can be heard. I just filed a missing item report with Uber, but am starting to suspect that none of my calls reached the driver in the first place. Has anyone had any similar experiences?

1558562265,uber,"Last night from 1:00am - 2:00am I took an Uber for a 70 mile trip home.  I was in the backseat and not inebriated or anything. I was just going home late after visiting my mother. Normally I take public transit but it wasn’t operational at that hour. 

Unfortunately, the driver was really tired. He followed the navigation just fine (wasn’t complicated just one freeway), but he kept drifting out of the lane, hitting the lane “bumps” (what we call “drunk bumps”), at least fifteen times or more.  He came very close to cars in other lanes, which was darn scary. 

This driver responded to my request in 3 minutes so clearly he wanted to drive 70 miles. So why was he driving so unsafely? If he wasn’t up to such a long drive he shouldn’t have accepted the fare. 

I reported him to Uber and got a refund. I feel bad because before me he had a high rating but honestly what else was I supposed to do? As a passenger I want to get home safe, and as a consumer I wouldn’t feel right not telling the company.

1558485272,uber,"I take an Uber to work almost every weekday in downtown Chicago. The route that the Uber app automatically gives (and Lyft as well to be fair - maybe based on Google Maps?) SUCKS. It always always says to take an exit that is majorly congested in the morning when I know you can just pass down to the next one and save 10+ minutes. Also at the very end of my route it thinks you can drive down an alley which is inaccessible. Even changing my dropoff location to nearby buildings to my office doesn't change the route. 

Here's the issue - I always very politely inform my driver of this at the beginning of the ride. Most drivers are cool and take my route, and some are even very happy to hear it or ask me first if I know a good route. But there's a really solid percentage of drivers who seem quite offended that I would even ask, or just straight up ignore me and add 15-20 minutes to my commute by taking the terrible GPS directions. Is there anything you can think of that I can say when I ask for my alternate route that might get the point across that I am legit just trying to help?

I will link it in the comments below. There is actual footage in the vid of the whole thing going down from one of the girls phones. It’s frustrating because at the end of the video you find out uber didn’t fire the guy. From how she describes their reaction to her reporting him it’s almost like uber didn’t think the guy did anything wrong.

So, weird right? But not a big deal just one crazy driver in another state shouldn’t effect me. Then this morning I get an ad on my FB. It reads “To all drivers, we couldn’t have said it better”  followed by a pic of a customer comment that reads “I had the most influential and spiritual talk with my uber driver tonight.

Uber just told me that they can't give me a refund or a credit. This is absurd to me. This is theft.

1558368421,uber,"I did the math, and if Uber stays as good as it was this past weekend when I decided to come back to it to test if they improved things for us with regards to pay--I will drive daily for the next 5 years.  My goal is to bring in $100 a day, this will give me $182,000 total, but the reality is there will be gas and some other maintenance costs so lets bring that number down to $140,000 at worst.  Keep in mind this isn't my main income that supports me, my main income I work a regular job and max out 401k and still able to pay mortgage and living after whats left over of that so the Uber money is all profit except gas.  The insurance is deducted from my regular paycheck of company I work for as the car I need to drive to my place of work, it isn't a fancy commercial insurance like the Uber Blacks have.  The car will get me to work and also to Uber driving.  The car only has $30k miles on it and it is a 2016 Camry, so by the end of the 5 year mark, it should have like over 200k miles.  I would have maintained it well by then, and I would be able to sell my home and get a profit out of that to.  The 401k should've reached around $200k or more depending on growth by then.  So with $400k+ total networth, I can just gtfo here and retire in Africa for good where everything from food to housing in cheap.  Some places in Africa you can build your own Condo Building for $60K and rent out each unit for $500+ a month, because construction labor is so cheap so I may do just that and give myself the penthouse.

1555905888,uber,"Been a long time user of Uber. Never had this happen to me before.

A couple days ago I requested a short ride (&lt;10 minutes) and had a $5 promo code from a referral. UberPool showed $0 after the promo code, UberX showed $2. I chose UberX since $2 wasn't a big deal for me and wanted full value of my promo.

Once I requested it, the app instantly asked me if I wanted to switch to Pool since there was a Pool car going straight there. I saw the route and thought hmm why not cause there was no other detour and $0 &gt; $2 if I'm getting there at the same time anyways.

So the car came right away and I sat in the front as there were 2 other passengers in the back. I got there without trouble and left a dollar tip.

Couple days later, I see that my account was charged over $3. That made no sense to me - at best I should be charged $1 for the tip. When I looked, it was charged as an UberX ride. 

I contacted support saying that this receipt made no sense and that I was charged for an UberX while riding a pool. They have been terribly unhelpful - constantly citing that they cannot refund me anything and that their prices are posted upfront. To add insult to injury, they suggested I take Pool next time if I'm worried about high surcharges (which they claim is the reason why I was charged $3). So essentially, they ignored my question of why my receipt says UberX and why I paid UberX prices when I rode with other passengers in a pool. Why even suggest the Pool option to me if you're going to charge me the same price as an UberX?

Anyone know if my situation is unique and whether I can reverse this charge? And how best to reach them since their app customer service team seems to be total ass and ignoring me.

$3 is not a big deal to me - I regularly tip that amount on longer rides. But I despite shady business practices and trying to fleece a customer that has been riding for 5+ years with a perfect 5 star rating on a measly $3. Super disappointing.",Charged for UberX when I took Pool

I just downloaded the Uber app to give it a shot because I will be heading to the airport tomorrow and I want to avoid the parking fee.

My question: is there another way to add first rider promo codes? I would rather get the $5 off 3 rides or even the 2.50.

But instead I got an immediate full refund without providing any explanation.  I then wrote support telling them the issue and asking them if they could readjust the fee and wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to my driver because he was extremely professional.

I have been taking 3-4 ubers per week for the past three years without any issue.

Tonight, as a 25 year old female traveling solo (with jacket zipped up to my neck and leggings - not that what I'm wearing should matter), I had an incident that I find truly disturbing, and I opted to walk out onto Toronto streets at 2:00 AM and by myself at night until I could find a cab, rather than stay in the car I was in.

I got into an Uber this evening and was laughed at and interrogated about the whereabouts of my boyfriend. I reassured the driver (not that it is ANY of his business) that I do in fact have a boyfriend who trusts me, but got lectured about how my behavior of being at a bar at night by myself, without him, is ""inappropriate"" according to his culture. This continued and escalated, with the driver until I got concerned for my safety, and for him knowing where I live. I requested that he pull over and stop driving - four times - until he finally unlocked the door on a busy avenue in my city, at which point I walked in the rain for twenty minutes until I was able to hail a cab.

Uber refunded me the $6 (THANK GOD BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT) from my trip, but has refused to acknowledge the absolute inappropriateness of the driver, or indicate that they would take any action. I have just let them know that I have video footage of part of it and that I am not afraid to seek legal counsel.

&amp;#x200B;

I created an Uber driver account like 2 months ago to start making some extra (much needed) cash.  I yet to drive or make any money.  I was approved for Uber but shortly after my app was saying *'Please contact support about your account'* at the bottom of the app.  I should also add I signed up to drive Lyft to which I am approved and can start driving whenever I'd like.  So back to Uber, naturally when you click that it just brings you to the help page with no more details on what my issue is or how or what reason I need to contact them. Fast forward a few more days and I finally find a phone number online to call support. This is where the frustration begins.

The support rep seemed like it was his first day, or maybe this is how all their support is. He kept putting me on hold, would come back and say the same 10-15 words and then hold again, return to finally say they see the issue with my account was *""My background check""*. That's it, it's all he said. Finally after grilling him for more details he puts me on hold again. He comes back and tells me it's because I had created another account, so in other words, I have two active accounts. It then dawned on me I created an account like 3 years ago to start driving with a different vehicle but I chickened out and never followed through with it. I completely forgot and then created this account. So the rep told me just that, I have two accounts. Easy right? Nope, it is all he said, not offering any solution. I said okay, I explained the mistake and all they have to do is delete that other account that I obviously never used.  All the while with a huge language barrier to deal with.  He seemed very confused, put me on hold **AGAIN** to come back and basically repeat the same thing **AGAIN**! this went on for like 3 more hold sessions on top of the previous 3 until I finally lost my cool and said: *""Hey, I get what the issue is, I just need you to tell me how we can fix it, so put me on hold as long as you'd like as long as when you return you tell me how we can fix this, thank you!"".* He again puts me on hold and returns saying he will have to submit this to a higher level support. That was it. Naturally after how poorly that conversation went I have no confidence it would be resolved. So I waited a day or two and found Uber's Twitter account and messaged them there. The good news is they reply right away. The bad news is, they are no help as I have found having shared many messages over many days. The last correspondence with them I got an email shortly after that my Uber password has changed. What, I never did that!  So I again messaged them on Twitter to again be vague with me. ""*We're still looking into this issue. We'll be sure to check back in with you once we've got a solution.  Thank you again for your understanding and patience.""*   This is one of many very similar responses I have been getting from them.  I was able to reset my password but I am seriously losing all confidence this will ever get resolved.

I've jumped from second job to second job working retail, food service etc., but class schedules are so spread out and funky that I was working from 6am-8am, then some from 7-11pm, working the primary on my days off and it was killing me. Even making better wages than most the hours they could give me were so few since I didn't have large blocks of time to come to work. 

Well I saved up and got a new Honda Pilot and realized I could do Uber and Uber XL so I started driving and my life has gotten so much easier. After gas expenses, the special insurance and a little budget for repairs I'm making an average of $22 an hour which is great for this area of the country. I can work on homework with the app running and just leave when I get an XL request or relax playing my switch in the car waiting for X or XL on weekend nights.

1555605177,uber,"So i am putting this out here because i don’t know what else to do. I am like most people who probably look to use uber as a simple taxi service to get around with ease, however sometimes it’s not so easy. Recently i got an $60 uber gift card, and uber managed to take my remaining $23 without me ever using it. On top of that, they charged me, FULL price, for 4 different rides, i never stepped foot in. After all of this happening, I tried to get in contact with them, and it has been back and forth for about 2 weeks now, and they have managed to snake their way out of my problems and keep my money. I was quite polite in the beginning, because of the fact that they don’t have a phone number to call, you have to message them and wait about 24 hours for a response. I believe this sort of thing allows them to get out of these situations, because over the phone its easy to make clear points and maybe have your problem resolved in a few hours, however, this messaging system makes it easier for them to avoid real communication, so people like me can have their problems resolved. However, that is off topic, but to send 3 messages, it almost takes a week. You can see where it gets frustrating. They also do this thing where a different employee responds to every message, so their is no clear idea of what has been going on when a different person answers. I also tried going to my bank, but since i used my debit card for the purchases, they are restricted by various laws, and could not help me. So i continued my messages with uber and after exchanging some harsh words, which was not smart of me, i got some clarity and was told i was going to get my money. So i relaxed a little, but that was not the end. It had been about a week since i was told this, so i asked again, and all they did was keep trying to have the case resolved, which it wasn’t, so i kept saying it was not resolved. After 3 days of going back and forth with some woman named KALSEY, who kept trying to end the issue as i would say i still need help, she finally cracked a little and said that they reviewed the case and said they couldn’t do anything. After telling her what the other woman had said, and even sending here screen shots of he text, she became aggravated, and banned my account and the account that i had used harsh language, but this was about a week and a half, and 20 messages after i had done that. In the end i spent about 3 weeks arguing, to have my problem resolved, and then revoked again, and now i am about $73.56 short, and nothing has been done. I thought i would put this out here to get some advice, or even to shed some light on the situation if anyone else is having a similar issue. Im not exactly giving up on the problem, but i don’t know where else to look, because uber won’t answer any of my emails, and the bank can’t do anything. I guess all i can do is wait, and maybe this will get resolved.",Did uber steal anyone else’s money?

Yesterday I was waiting for a scheduled ride and was watching the app which said the driver was 1 minute away; it never said he arrived and he never messaged or called me. If I’m supposed to go outside when he’s a minute away I didn’t know that, I expected an “arrived” notification. A few minutes later it went from 1 minute away to canceled, and I figured he’d gotten lost or had something come up, and I got a new ride (this time I was told he was here). Then I saw that the canceled driver had left me a one star rating and I realized he must’ve waited for me without alerting me and canceled because I didn’t come out. I rated my actual rides 5 and tipped, but I guess they didn’t rate me since I’m still at 1 star.

1552869428,uber,"Late last night in LA I requested an Uber. A car accepted immediately, and the app immediately showed the ride as already starting.  Within a minute or so, it appeared as if the ride had ended, and it prompted me to rate the driver (I was still on the curb and never saw, let alone got into, a car). We end up taking a Lyft home. 

This morning I notice I’ve been charged $5.80 for the ride. No biggie, this thing happens. I can just let them know and they’ll refund me.

Then... I see that the driver has added a $150 cleaning fee.  Again, I didn’t even see this car, let alone get in it.

The driver’s profile has a 2.83 rating and has been active for one day. The driver’s photo appears to be a stock headshot photo.

I requested pool and I was picked up first. Then 3 mins after I got on the car, I was notified that someone else will join the ride. I was looking at the uber app as the driver made his way,  but I noticed that he didn’t even bother picking up my co-rider. He obviously knew he had to pick up someone but he kept going to my destination. 5 minutes we reach my destination, the co-rider sends the driver multiple messages, probably asking why she’s not getting picked her up. The driver ignored the message and continued to go to my destination. I don’t know if the driver or co-rider ended up canceling the ride but someone did. So i ended up reaching my destination without a co-rider.

For clarity, when a person schedules a ride far enough in advance, Uber guarantees that the driver will arrive within a fifteen minute window of time starting with the time you selected and if they don’t arrive in that window of time, you will get $10 off your next ride. 

I scheduled an Uber last night for 6:30am today.  The pickup window was 6:30-6:45. I always do this, and most drivers get to me by close to 6:30, give or take a couple of minutes on either side. 

This morning, my driver arrived at 6:17am. That’s nearly fifteen minutes early, and if I’d have told him I wasn’t ready yet, he would have charged me a late fee even though according to the time I scheduled, I wasn’t late.

This has happened multiple times. I’ve taken to getting ready 30 minutes early to avoid having to scramble to get out the door. On top of that, I can’t always get inside at my work until 6:45, so when the driver is that early, I often have to wait in the cold for a substantial amount of time. It sucks, but it doesn’t seem like very many people are having this problem, so Uber isn’t likely to do anything about it.

TLDR: We win a $300 gift card for Uber Eats, try to use it with a new account and Uber immediately bans us for fraud, refuses to tell us why and has basically stolen $300 from us.

Full story: So, my father in law won a tailgate party pack from an online contest offered being held by Highland Park Whiskey: [http://goout365.com/highlandparktailgate](http://goout365.com/highlandparktailgate)

That contest in particular. It's pretty cool, we got Highland Park stuff and a $300 gift card for Uber Eats. Downside is we get it in the mail the day after the Superbowl, but whatever we can still get food! My FiL has never used Uber and isn't a big tech guy, so we set up a new Uber account and activate the gift card for him.

The gift card works, we have a $300 credit in the app showing. We add a credit card and verify the email. Then we try to place our order. Here's where things get funky- the app let's us go all the way to the end of the order process and then says the order is invalid. So I restart the app, thinking maybe something just went wrong. As soon as I go to log back in, the app tells me that the account is disabled. WTF? It also gives me a link to request re-activation.

I follow the link and submit the info, and within like 20 minutes I get a reply saying the account was accidentally flagged for fraud but it's back up. Okay, cool. I am able to log back in, so I do the whole order over, and try to place it. Same error code. Account disabled.

I send ANOTHER email. Get another response, says the same thing. Accidental flag. Try again. Can log in, try order, order invalid. Submit another email. No response now.

So this all happened last night. This morning we get an email from Uber that says that our account has been suspended and will not be re-activated. So we're out $300, and apparently there's no support number I can call to try to get this figured out.

So thanks Uber, hope you enjoy that $300. For anyone else, I would strongly recommend against trying to use giftcard on a new account, no matter how well verified the account is.

The passenger set the destination to a place where he said my friend could answer a few questions and get £50 and if he logged in to show them his earnings etc. they would pay him another £50. Apparently they had been doing this the whole day. He at the time was hesitant and was told by the passenger that he could come back to that place in the coming days if he changed his mind.

I searched around online and couldn't find anything about this.

I guess my question is, is this allowed? Are drivers allowed to answer questions about working as private hire drivers. Are they allowed to show another company their earnings and their hours through Uber?

I was in Charleston for New Year’s Eve to see some friends. The Saturday before New Years, me (21f) and my best friend (22f) went to her favorite bar. She lives in Charleston, so she knew the bartender, the bouncer, and the manager there that night. They were all so happy to see her, giving her hugs and being so kind to me. We got free drinks all night, after having pregamed quite heavily. She was doing absolutely fine, and I thought I was too. But then I sat down and it all hit me. I knew I had to get out of there before I got sick. 
I told my friend I was going outside for a minute for some air, and as soon as I got outside I ordered an uber as I could hardly stand straight. My uber was there within 2 minutes. 
Reggie asked me to sit in the front seat, and I poured myself in and closed the door. This is how you know I was drunk; I didn’t even buckle my seatbelt. I ALWAYS buckle my seatbelt.
Anyway. I manage to text my friend that I’m sorry I left her, but I was too drunk and knew she would be fine since she had friends there (like, 6 girls from her sorority). But that texting and the driving made my stomach churn. About two blocks from her house, I know I’m gonna Ralph, so I ask the uber driver to pull over. Our convo was a little something like this:

Me: “you can drop me off at the corner, I’ll walk from here.”
Reggie: (obviously not believing I could stand up let alone walk) “are you sure? I’ll take you the whole way.”
Me: “really, it’s okay, it’s close, I’ll get out.”
Reggie: “are you sure? It’s still a couple blocks.”
Me: “I’m about to be sick”
Reggie: “okay hang on”

And then he pulled to the side of the road, I stepped out of the car, and got sick in a bush. A lot. Reggie gets out of the car and walks over to my side of the car. I kept apologizing profusely in between gagging. He kept telling me it was okay. He told me to sit back down on the edge of the seat with the door open. I sat there and emptied my stomach for ten minutes, all while Reggie smoked a cigarette and told me, “it’s okay sweetheart. Get it all out. You’re okay. Don’t get it on your shoes sweetheart.” 
(I did get it on my shoes)
I kept shaking my head and apologizing and he told me to stop apologizing, that I hadn’t gotten sick in his car, that he’s dealt with much worse. When I’m ready, we start to drive again but I ask him to pull over a few minutes later. He stands outside with me again, telling me it’s alright, I’m doing fine, we can take all the time I need. 
When we got to my friends house, he waited by his car until I could unlock the gate and get inside. He got a very nice tip for sure. 
Basically I just want to say Reggie, thank you so much. You were so kind and helpful. You made me feel so much better about being a dumb drunk white girl getting sick out of your uber. You knew I was in no condition to walk home, and you made sure I got home safely. I swear you were my guardian angel that night for not letting me wander around the city in a slinky black dress at 1 am puking. If I could give you 100 stars I would.

1546790438,uber,"I write this here since neither Uber support, nor any comments on the Play or App Store seem to get noticed or acted upon by Uber. Since I noticed the following issue, 

I have unsuccessfully tried many times to report the issue, but the constant canned message reaponses from Uber support are hellish at best and it seems nobody from their personnel really READS the submitted entries from drivers!  The issue I've had many timez is that the driver (and even the passager) app mistakes addresses because of them being incomplete. 

For example, it may select a Street 1, San Juan, Puerto Rico. San Juan HAS a LOT of places that have Street 1 as part of the address, just specifying that is prone to have a Street 1 selected that is NOT the correct one! If the apps included the suburb or area in which the street is, the problem would be minimized. 

Recently I had the issue again when I tried to pickup a rider at Calle 14. Bayamón, Puerto Rico, as the app showed ito be. When I arrived there, nobody was around so I called the rider. When the rider responded, she told me I was at the correct street but wrong area. I asked what other places / references where around and after a quick exchange of info I realized the app directed me about 2 miles from the correct location: Calle 14, Urb. Flamboyan Gardens, Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Since I am familiar with the area I was able to tell the rider I would be there in five minutes and I was able to pickup my rider and take her to her destination correctly.  

The app is not only using incomplete addresses but it seems it does NOT take or use any GPS information to verify the locations are the correct ones! It just assumes the address is correct even thou it may be incomplete or constrained to a certain amount of characters. 

I don't think I am the only one with the problem, but referring the issue to Uber is hell at best, since the app only provides fixed options to fixed situations and they have not provided ways to report on any other issue but the ones they included within the app. ",Recurring Uber issue

1546544725,uber,"The express pool almost always asks me to meet my driver on a street corner and get picked up from the street side.   In my city (Las Vegas) speed limits are 35mph on average with 3 lane roads in most places and 45mph 4 lane in front of my apartment. If I request an express pickup it asks me to wait on the side of the road and get picked up there.   The driver has to stop in the right lane of traffic and block the cycling lane as well forcing cyclist into the street.  There have been multiple close calls of cars either almost rear ending my driver, once a cyclist was yelling at us and multiple times they just went out into traffic in a 45.  

My suggestion would be to only set pickup points in parking lots or doting them all over the cities in safe places instead of street corners.  I suppose it probably works better in more crowded and slow cities but it definitely is not a one size fits all solution.  For now I game the system by moving my pickup point so the edges don't touch any major streets, this changes my pickup point from the street in front to the front of the neighborhood.  Setting up pre-determined pickup points for express throughout the city would also stop people from being bale to abuse the system like that.  ","Uber Pool Express is a great idea.

Take a look at this one - They don't say where the additional $5.47 came from, but it was removed from a promotion. This was a quick 5 mile trip.

1546448940,uber,"I'm in Philadelphia planning to have surgery on my driving foot in Baltimore (around 2 hour drive). I plan to Uber both ways as I don't want to be hobbling on a bus and I'm willing to pay extra for convenient door to door transportation post surgery. I've read some posts on long ride best practices but still have several questions. 

Articles say to call the driver to see if they are willing to take the long ride. If they say no are they the ones to cancel or do I? What if our conversation went over 2 minutes and I would be charged for the cancellation (ie if they didn't pick up right away or took a while to think about it)? Does it hurt them to cancel the ride? 

Is Baltimore in the Philly coverage area (and vice versa) so they could work at the destination or would the driver be stuck with an unpaid return trip each way? What about for Lyft or UberBlack? I'm willing to use one of these if it allows them to make some money at the destination as well. 

It's recommended to tip the driver extra for the unpaid return trip. If I do UberBlack is this necessary or can I consider that built into the higher cost of UberBlack? 

It seems like the perfect situation would be to Uber down, the driver could work in Baltimore during the day (probably 6-8 hours from start to end of my surgery but this could vary widely), then I could call them for a ride home that night. This would be a big pay day for the driver and avoid two wasteful return trips and it would be comforting to have someone I know for the ride back after the surgery. But I'm not sure if this is possible (because of coverage areas) or how I would arrange all this if it was or worth the hassle. 

Are there any other options I could look into? I thought about hiring a driver for a day but unless they are licensed to work in Baltimore I'd basically have to pay them for a day's worth of downtime. But if they're getting two guaranteed long trips with no unpaid return would this be worthwhile? What would a reasonable offer be? Where would I even set this up?

I had a couple of drinks with my wife for NYE, and while I felt ok and probably COULD have driven, we didn't want to chance it, and took an Uber home. The ride itself wasn't great. He kept looking at good phone in the rain, which made us both feel unsafe. But even worse, my wife left her phone in the back seat when we got out and here's where things got interesting:

1) it is impossible to log in to an Uber account without being in possession of the phone for verification
2) it is impossible to speak to a human being for customer service

After about an hour of anger and panic that her brand new phone was gone, my wife has a great idea. She logged into her Google account and tracked her phone that way. But we noticed something odd... When we would ring a distress signal to the phone, it was manually getting turned off. So we kept an eye on it's location and kept pinging it, only for it to be silenced. After another hour or so, it stopped moving in a parking lot. We waited about 20 minutes, and then decided to go to it. When we arrived, our Uber driver was there, laying in his car. So I went up to the car, and explained that I think I left my phone, and I tracked it back to this location. He proceeded to tell me that 3 different phones were left in his car and they've been ""blowing up"". Extremely frustrated by the events of the last 2 hours, my first thought was ""why don't you just fucking answer them asshole?"", but it was after 3am, so I just took my wife's phone and left.

This was higher than normal for a short trip (given the NFL game), but I chose this option over free public transportation for students because it was crowded and would have taken twice as long to get home.  My Uber driver arrived, told me it was her 2nd day driving for Uber, held her phone in one of her hands to look at her GPS as she drove, missed countless turns, went 6 miles in the wrong direction (making the trip an extra 10-15 minutes), didn't listen to me saying ""turn, turn, turn!"" when she was supposed to turn (making me believe she was trying to take me somewhere against my will), and told me we were going to stop for gas soon so we ""didn't have to talk.""

I shared my location with my girlfriend and when she saw how far the driver was taking me in the opposite direction she considering calling the police.  The driver kept driving after ignoring the GPS that told her to turn left at a red light onto my street, so I demanded that she stop so I could walk an extra block to my destination instead of staying in the car with her.  Upon exiting her vehicle, I found that my bill was a bit over $46.00.  As a college student, this was absolutely appalling to me, because I cannot afford a bill that high and would never consider paying for an Uber that costs that much.

Holierthanthee and others recall me posting insane amount of earnings of like $75 and $80 for just 1.5 hours in UberX and that was the trick Uber was using to hook us drivers into believing we will keep earning a lot with this gig, but that was far from the true reality.  The true reality arrived when I picked up a lady in a snow storm from airport and took her to a super far away city about 3 or so weeks ago.  That was also on a 1.6X surge which should've had me earning well over $40, but now, I only got $28.  Uber ate the money I was supposed to get.  And that lady never ended up tipping even days later.  

At least with the Eats business Uber gives daily hourly Boosts.  

So now I just work my full-time day job, I have more enough time for Gym and staying healthy instead of running around driving people for $3 or $5 in UberX which isn't even worth it.  The UberEats that is worth it gets good around 8pm and even better Fridays to Sundays where people stay home and order food.  So most of the week I don't even drive the UberEats except for the times where the demand and earnings get high.

1543425072,uber,"I am unsure if this is the correct place to post this, but I am unsure how else to proceed. Sorry for wall of text:

Around a week ago, I received a $100 uber gift card. My first thought was to get some tasty food delivered directly to my hungover face. I had an unpaid balance (of around $22) that was preventing this from happening. 

I contacted uber support, and after being shuffled between several people I was eventually able to charge that balance to the gift card balance. 

The amount was removed from my balance, however, the app was still saying I had an unpaid balance. I contacted support again, explained what had happened, and very quickly they were able to unlock my account. 

Over the next week I made 3 total orders for myself and my roomate that reached a total of around $70 (including the past balance that was paid). Meaning there should still be around $30 left on the giftcard balance. However, to my surprise I find that there is no balance remaining. 

It turns out that they charged me twice for the unpaid balance. Understandable, considering how much I was bounced around between phone / email reps. 

So, I contact support again in an effort to be refunded that balance. This was on August 21, 2018. Since then, I have exchanged over a dozen emails with customer support. All but one reply has been a copy pasted canned response of ""we will get back to you soon"". The one exception was when I was sent a screen shot of my charging, including the erroneous double charge. When I provided my own screenshots and emails as proof of this, I was sent another copy paste response. 

I am now being ignored by customer support completely, as it has been 48 hours since their last response. At this point, it's more of a matter of pride than being about the $20. I have never before experienced this lack of courtesy from customer support. Unsure how to proceed.  ",Customer Service Issues
1543415859,uber,"I wrote this on the Uber Drivers subreddit, but id like to share it with the passengers who seem to frequent this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

 One constant that can be seen throughout this subreddit, and which seems to hold true in so many situations is the sentiment to not take Pool passengers. While most non-drivers will dismiss this as being purely economic \[drivers make less with pool rides as compared to UberX+\], the drawbacks of Uber Pool extend far beyond that. After only a few hundred trips, it becomes clear why drivers avoid pool requests. Im going to outline a few issues with pool below, and give my take on potential solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest complaint is that Uber Pool undermines the rating system of the app due to its feature of adding random passengers automatically. Let me be clear as to why: for drivers, the rating system is there to warn us of problem passengers. It shows us that this particular passenger has a history of problematic behavior. Most drivers will automatically rate any riders five stars, and only report if there's a good reason to do so. That being said, if I have a car full of people, the last thing I want is a 3.83 rated passenger automatically added to my ride. This creates an unsafe environment for both the passengers and the drivers. Additionally, due to how the app works, any issues that arise from this will usually be blamed on the driver. Going further, low passenger ratings arent limited to behavior but can include cleanliness, body odor, and inappropriate personal phone calls with other passengers in the car which again, will all fall on the driver.

&amp;#x200B;

A potential solution would be to have a rating minimum for passengers wanting to take pool. Drivers are held at a very high standard of about a 4.6 rating. If passengers want the privilege to take a cheaper ride, they should be held to some sort of standard as well. If a passenger falls below a certain rating due to their continuous actions, take away their ability to take Uber Pool or Uber Express until they raise their rating or are reviewed (this of course should be implemented after the passenger has already taken numerous rides so as to not ban someone who had one bad rating out of five).

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue with Uber Pool and Express, particularly Express, is passengers will oftentimes act entitled to having an UberX experience despite not paying for one. Riders who insist on drivers taking them to their after trip destination so they dont have to walk even though they picked Express and passengers who are late for work or an obligation getting angry for the driver picking up multiple people are not acceptable. As a prior passengers, I oftentimes witnessed other pool passengers angrily insisting that drivers not accept new requests despite new passengers getting added on automatically. Drivers who stand up to these rude passengers will oftentimes be rated low, or worse, have a false report filed on them. There needs to be an option to rate passengers low for ""improper use of Uber Pool"", with an ability to outline the report. Multiple reports of improper use of Uber Pool needs to lead to the passenger being unable to use Pool.

&amp;#x200B;

I fully understand that at the end of the day, all Uber cares about is profits and so passenger restrictions and rules like these will most likely never be implemented. But, I will begin reporting all instances of this and urge drivers to do the same. We are a rideshare service, not a personal chauffeur to our pool passengers. Passengers who want the chauffeur experience can pay the few extra dollars for Uber X. Drivers shouldn't have to feel unsafe or be forced to go against the rules to appease these passengers looking to save a few bucks and make a generally unpleasant experience for all involved. And if not for the sake of the driver, then maybe for the sake of the other pool passengers who are acting appropriately and following the rules.",[Crosspost] The Issues with Pool- Improper Use and the Undermining of the Rating System

1543280895,uber,"I'll try to put this in ascending order of frustration.

* The new compass icon for North is dumb. It is an arrow that points both north and south, with north being black and south being white. After months of using it I still frequently have to remind myself which way the compass is pointing, which is just a needless added mental step when glancing at the map while moving.

* You can't adjust the volume of the app's notifications. In particular with the updated notification sounds, which are way less subtle than the only ones, I find this really irritating.

* You can't view your lifetime stats. Where previously you could see how many five-star ratings you'd received and how many trips you'd been rated on, *ever*, now you are only given numbers from your last 500 trips. Not the end of the world, but being able to calculate roughly what percentage of riders are bothering to rate at all felt useful. Additionally, not having a running total there's no way to know whether you've hit milestones like 1000, 1500, 2000 five-star trips and since those come with flair it's helpful to know where you are. It's an odd metric to suddenly withhold from us as ""independent contractors"" who are meant to be treating the job like a small business

* You can't view your trip cancellation/acceptance stats, unless it's been moved somewhere in-app that I haven't found it. Again, an odd metric to suddenly withhold when those are used to determine our monthly VIP status.

* The app functions are unavailable while moving. I get it, somebody decided that this was a safety thing. But it is really irritating to not be able to interact with the app at all while the vehicle is moving except to set or remove driver destinations.

* The revolving ""You're Online"" &amp; ""Finding Nearby Trips"" prompt is unnecessary visual clutter. It's actually distracting to have what appear to be fresh notifications popping up in the corner of your vision while you're driving, particularly since the text  *does* occasionally change to ""You're in a busy area, expect a trip soon"" or ""Opportunity Nearby."" It's one more thing to potentially take your eyes off the road and it doesn't serve any purpose.

* You can't interact with the map *at all* except to zoom in and out. You can't manually rotate it or nudge it to force a street name to appear, which is a wild thing to omit in a navigation app. Again, it just removes information that is useful for drivers for no apparent reason.

* When you have an active destination trip, the map zooms out to the full distance between the rider's pickup and *your* destination. If I'm 10 miles from my destination, but the destination trip is only going half a mile, this makes the map visually unusable for navigation.

**And the two big ones:**

* There's a persistent bug that causes the app to go blank after you've accepted a trip. The trip prompt appears, you accept, the prompt disappears and the app returns to looking like you don't have a ride—no rider name, no pickup address, nothing. But on the rider's end they're still expecting you. Closing and re-opening the app doesn't solve it. Rebooting the whole fucking device does. Phone boots back up, you open the Uber app and presto, there's your rider and their pickup point. I've nearly lost two trips and have actually lost one trip because of this, because the rider just sees you wandering around and unless they bother to call or text you may as well have never accepted their ride. This has happened to me six times since the new app rolled out, and **there is no way to submit a bug report to Uber.**

* Lastly, and my biggest gripe: the app clickjacks your phone with notifications such as ""New rider automatically added"" during a Pool ride. Formerly you could dismiss the app's popups with a touch, but now they clickjack your screen until they time out on their own. When an added Pool rider immediately changes your route this is a real problem. I use Waze for navigation, and when a rider is added to a Pool trip I close Waze and use Uber to navigate to their pickup. Not only do I prefer to navigate to rider pickups with the Uber app, but when Waze resets for an adjusted route there's a delay before it shows you your next turn. Given how frequently riders being added to Pool cause you to need to make a turn almost *immediately*, being unable to dismiss the goddamn popups and return to the map of your choice can create huge problems for getting to riders. A missed turn on a busy street can add minutes—potentially a lot of minutes—to the trip, and now you're inconveniencing both the rider who's already in the car and the rider who's waiting to be picked up. Forget about a missed highway exit. The app's popups basically freeze your device now for several seconds, totally blinding your navigation. It's just a real blockheaded way of implementing the popups, and it's one more way that the new app feels like it wasn't designed with driver input at all.

Anyway, if anyone has workarounds or solutions for any of that, or if I'm completely wrong about things like lifetime stats being removed, I'd love to hear it.","Having used the new driver app for a couple of months now, I'm frustrated by the inability to provide any user feedback.

I go on my app and am happy to see there's 7-10 little cars within at least a 2 block radius around me, signifying that someone is bound to get me quickly.

1540842922,uber,"Hi, well I didn't think I'd have to post here again so soon. 

As many of you are probably aware, Uber decided to shut down boost in many areas it seems. We are unable to talk to anyone directly about this, as any Uber Eats concerns while not on an active trip are relegated to email only support, which is a complete joke. 

For the last 8+ months, from 11am-9pm there has been boost pricing for the entire city (Spokane, WA). This has been the only reason this job was feasible, as it brought my hourly up to $23+/hr on a normal day. With boost gone, I'm down to $12-15/hr before gas costs. This has effectively destroyed my job, a week before moving into a new house. 

There was no warning. There is no announcement regarding it whatsoever, most importantly, will it be back?

Uber is slowly becoming a giant joke. They don't support their support structure with the power to help, and it's all at the expense of the people paying the CEO bonus. 

When will they realize that AI cars are still years out, and that they need to treat us with basic decency and respect? What other occupations cut their workers pay by 40% with no notice or given (good) reason?

I was dropping off a Brazilian couple to tonight when the husband asked me: “Hey I noticed you have music turned off.. do you normally drive without listening to music?”

I said nope, I only leave it off while driving for Uber and will turn it on upon passenger’s request. I said I can turn it on now if they tell me what they’d like to listen to, and he said “Hell no, we want no music!” He then said a lot of drivers have loud music on while picking them up, and his wife has chronic headache, and that their ratings go down whenever they politely ask the driver to turn off the music.

He then pointed out how I have “Ask about music” on my Fun Fact section of profile, and said that’s the best practice, ever.

Seriously, I actually get why drivers would play music while picking up the rider. It‘s very inconvenient for me to go any moment in my car without blasting my music, but this is one of few things I sacrifice to provide great customer service while still firmly believing that all drivers should provide their service their own way since we’re independent contractors.

1540750684,uber,"I had a pair of passengers the other night, super drunk and kind of a pain with their requests. They weren't jerks, though, they were nice, just too drunk to really think clearly. Anyway, about halfway through the drive one of the passengers announces she needs to puke, and I helpfully point her to the vomit bags I have in the seat backs (been driving for 8 months and this is luckily the first time I've needed to use them). I pull over to a side street so she can do her business, and I hear her in the back absolutely filling one of the bags. We've stopped for a few minutes, she cleans up and rinses her mouth out, and we take off. I finish her part of the ride, and then take the other passenger to his dropoff location.   


After dropping him off I pull down the street to check my back seats and wipe down my door if she happened to get any vomit on it, and I see that her seat is completely soaked. And I mean soaked; not just damp but drenched. When I pressed a paper towel into it you could see water rising out of the seat. Not sure what the liquid was, but it didn't smell like vomit or urine.   


Luckily I keep a wide array of cleaning supplies in my trunk, and I was able to do a pretty thorough job on the messafter first sending pics and a claim in to Uber. The next day I see a $150 payment for cleaning fees in my account, which while awesome, has me a little worried.  


I don't personally think the damage was worth $150, as I was able to clean it myself. It did cost me time off the road on a really busy night causing me to miss bonuses I had been gunning for, but in terms of damage and repair $150 seems steep. My question is, with passengers so concerned with scams, how would this be handled if the PAX contested it? She did cause the damage, without a doubt, but if she contests it I'd really hate to be docked $150 on a future week.

1540747452,uber,"Hi, I have been an Uber driver for almost 3 years now. I started by doing just normal Uber, but slowly started to make Uber Eats my priority as it was bringing me more money for less time on the road. Fast forward a few months, and I had a first happen: a customer claims that I never delivered their food. I was made aware of this merely by an adjustment deducted from my account. I had just cashed out earlier in the day, so I was at $0.00 when the adjustment came through. It was about a $10 delivery, so I was suddenly $10 in the hole. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I call regular Uber support, and was told they could do nothing. They said to just email the support team, but I was adamant that that support would not be enough, as the email team is always someone different, EVERY time there's a reply, so you have to keep re explaining things you told the previous support agent. So the regular Uber agent told me he would transfer me to a supervisor of the Uber Eats support team. Well, I was on hold for almost 2 1/2 hours, and decided that was enough. I hung up and proceeded to call again.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, there were responses from the Uber Eats email team, implying that I had done something wrong. Trusting 100% with no proof that the customer was telling the truth. I explained there, and on the phone that this was bogus, and was a false claim by the customer. I am certain i got it to the right person, because as I pulled up, she flagged me down, called me by name, and had a cash tip in her hand for after I handed her the food. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that I need to review proper dropoff procedures, and that this was 100% my fault. I wasn't listened to at all. And I'm now made out as a thief and a liar as far as Uber is concerned, and my job depends on this. I've taken over 1100 trips with Uber and have a 4.91 on the regular side, and was at 99% on deliveries until this lying piece of shit claimed that she never got her food.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told by Uber support in NO uncertain terms, that there is NO way to fight this, that there is NO way to prevent it from happening again, and that the adjustment was already made, so it would be pointless to try and fight it either way.

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short: this lady got free food, and I got dinged. Uber gets off scott free and was able to STEAL MONEY FROM ME. So now next time I clock on, the first $10 I work will disappear. 

&amp;#x200B;

FUCK UBER. I work hard and for there to be no recompense, no investigation, no dissemination of evidence before illegally stealing money from me is abhorrent. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I was on my way home and my driver decided to answer a phone call over hands free without asking if it were ok. I believe in common curtesy, which I know a lot of you Believe that you do not work for the driver but rather Uber. As a driver you are a business owner that offers a Service to your riders and I believe common courtesy is a big part of this. After a long day it would’ve been nice to be able to get into the car and not have to listen to his personal phone call especially when he didn’t bother asking me if it was alright. 

The ride was not very long .. he could see the approximate time it would take to drive me on his GPS .. If the phone call was a matter of personal health or of severity I would’ve completely understood; however,  he showed complete disregard for his pax and answered anyways. 

I work in sales/marketing for the past 7 years and in the timeframe I have never once stopped in the middle of a sale to answer a personal phone call .. under any circumstances! I believe that the customer deserves more than that and you should be held to the highest standard when representing both yourself and the business (whether it is your own business or someone else’s business does not matter).

Funny enough I saw him a comment on a post like the one I am making and someone said “your very self centred to expect the driver would put his life on hold for you” lol 

But isn’t that what we all do in a professional environment? Does the grocery store employee take personal calls in the middle of cashing somebody out?

1540394287,uber,"First off, I’ve been driving with Uber full time for the past year just to establish some credentials. I’ve put up with enough of this shady stuff from them. The absolute BS today is that I’ve caught them red handing not only screwing me out of my pay using their arbitrary “Booking and Service fee” BS but also screwing the riders out of money as well.

Take a look at the breakdown of my “Earnings” for two airport rides I gave this morning.

https://imgur.com/jg1mVcT
https://imgur.com/ZiMRrok

This is the first ride I gave to the airport this morning. Everything seems fine, Rider paid what I’d expect, I got paid out a decent amount, We even took a E-470 the local toll road so a portion of what the rider paid is given to me to cover toll fees. Uber took 24% and I got the rest. Absolutely fine with that. (However the toll road we took actually charges a total of $15 dollars one way to the airport, and uber doesn’t compensate drivers the amount needed to fully reimburse that)

https://imgur.com/g4VZN2G
https://imgur.com/25XIyHA

Here is where the shady BS starts. This is my second ride, also to the airport, from nearly the same distance, the only difference is we didn’t take a toll road this time. As you’ll note, the distance only has a 2 mile difference, and the time a 9 minute difference. You expect me to believe in 9 minutes and 2 miles, the rider is going to be charged an extra $27? When we didn’t even take a toll road?

That’s insult number 1. They overcharged the rider who took what should have been the more economical route.

Insult number 2? This shady company took 62% of my earnings for this ride. OVER HALF WHAT THE RIDER PAID! For a “Booking and service” fee. Are you kidding? Try and tell me that isn’t arbitrary. Even the rates for time and distance change.

And what does a driver get when they inquire about these “Service Fees” you ask? This load of BS

It’s worked out my sophomore and currently junior year, all my drivers have been given good or even amazing customer service. Never once did Uber enforce the rule that you have to ride with an adult if you’re a minor. Literally almost all drivers break that rule. Anyways, this morning I had to take an Uber and it said it’d be arriving in 4 minutes. Cool. So when my driver arrived, who btw was a male in his 30-40s but that didn’t bother me because a lot of my drivers were males.  I stepped in and idk why the wrench on the floor caught me a little off guard. I let that slide because I was just trying to get to school. He starts playing this weird genre of music that was like heavy metal and that was kinda weird to me too because most of my drivers played either radio music or anything relaxing. I’m not a picky person and I just want to get from point A to point B but something in my gut told me that was weird. I glanced at his phone for half a second and he started to change the music until he found a song that wasn’t as intense. Reminder, it’s about 7 in the morning. It’s not safe to be changing the songs while driving and that’s pretty obvious, is it not? But back to the story, he started driving through a neighborhood and then he drove through multiple ones instead of driving through the street. He was not following the directions of the GPS. I always check the license plate and type of color as well as the color of the car prior to going in and so I knew for a fact that he was my assigned driver. I had the 911 option ready in case I needed to call but I was starting to get anxiety. My heart was beating really fast and I was alone and so scared that he wasn’t going to drive me to school. I was actually about to call 911 until he turned and dropped me off at my high school but I had a hunch and a gut feeling that something was off with that guy. He also kept looking back when he was driving and I don’t understand why he couldn’t just focus on the road. Uber had sent me a message that basically apologized for my experience but said that minors are not allowed to have Uber accounts and that we cannot request a ride without an adult. That rule is not strongly enforced and they should hold employees accountable for that breaking that because it’s pretty obvious that if someone with a young face with a backpack is asking you to bring them to their high school, or wherever, they’re clearly minors. It’s absolute bullshit that they aren’t really doing much about my situation and I doubt that they’re gonna talk to my driver about it or at least send a damn email.

1537590648,uber,"This happened a few weeks ago.

Im a security officer at a 55 and older gated community. we have a front gate that is open 24 hours and a night patrol (me) 10 hours a night.

What happened was just before my shift started we had 3 uber drivers come to the gatehouse about 10 minutes apart, Each gave an address that was not on our property, the street name was but the building number was not. The first 2 drivers showed us the GPS showing where the address was but when we explained that the address was not on the property (even showed them a map of the property) they were cool about it...they tried to call the person but got no answer. Both drivers then said they would cancel the call and go on to another and left without any problem.

The issues was with the 3rd driver. He gave the same address as the other 2, same first name too..but when we tried to explain that the address does not exist on this property he got agitated. 

He said ""well, my GPS says its here so let me in.""

Again we tried to get him to understand the address was not on the property but he just got more and more irritated. He finally said ""just open the fuckin gate so i can get my fuckin fair!""

Nope, sorry. Not even now after that.

H refused to look at our map that showed clearly that the address didn't exist on our property. He didn't even bother to call the client to try to verify.

That was big problem number 1...

Big problem number 2 was this:

Due to the way the gatehouse is designed (most gatehouses in fact) there is no way we can get someone to turn around and leave the property if we refuse entry unless we open the gate and have them pull behind the gatehouse. Thats what we had to do. 

The lady working the gatehouse told him he was not coming in, the address is not on this property.

A car came up behind the uber driver and the gatehouse officer told the uber driver that he had to pull around the gatehouse, he was not to come on the property. She then opened the gate and he pulled through. he started to turn behind the gatehouse but then turned back straight and entered the property. Since i was at the gatehouse i was able to jump in the patrol vehicle and locate him. I got out and when i approached him, i informed him that he was trespassing and he needed to leave. I demanded he give me ID and he told me to ""fuck off, i don't have to give you a fucking thing""

He then backed out of the parking space he was in and almost hit me and my patrol vehicle. I followed him until he left the property.

I tried contacting uber via twitter but they only want to know problems as a user...but people like us...security...we deal with drivers too. 

I wanted to know if there was a number to call or an email i can send information to. If this guy had that kind of attitude, lord knows how he would treat his rider...",Security officer needs information on how to deal with a bad driver

Last night I took a ride with two others, so two of us sat in back and one in the front seat. This driver had a dog and with our seating arrangement he had to drive with the dog in his lap. This is illegal under our distracted driving laws here, and we weren't fans of the situation. 

I reached out to uber and they said that since drivers are private contractors this is allowed. This really surprised me since in an uberx, the driver can expect up to 4 passengers which would fill all the seats forcing the dog either on a passenger's lap or the driver's lap.

1537302889,uber,"This is a friendly reminder of how to make your driver happy! (If you're into that kind of thing)

Very few people have a perfect rating, so don’t despair if your average isn’t 5.0. Things that seem small to you can matter to your driver - it’s easy to accidentally slam a door if you’re not thinking about it. Knowing a little more about the things that affect a driver’s happiness can help you be a 5-star rider.

Short wait times.
Drivers love when riders are ready to go when they arrive at the pickup location. That includes making sure the location you entered is actually where you’ll be.

Courtesy.
Simple but true - it’s important that riders treat drivers and their cars the way they’d expect to be treated themselves. A positive attitude and considerate use of the car go a long way. That slice of pizza can wait.

Safety.
Drivers want to make sure everyone in their car is safe. Drivers shouldn’t be encouraged to break any laws. For example, every rider in the car should have their own seatbelt.
Why your rating matters
Ratings foster mutual respect between riders and drivers. This strengthens our community and helps everyone get the most from Uber. Just as you expect drivers to treat you with respect, drivers hope to feel the same acknowledgement from riders. A high rating is about more than bragging rights among your friends; it’s a sign that people enjoyed their time with you. Keep up the good work!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a grad student in a big college town. I went out with some friends Friday night, got too drunk, and decided to Uber home. I'm not really a big drinker, and on top of that, I was \*really\* drunk. When the car started moving I started to feel sick, the driver, a middle aged dude, pulled over and I opened the door and puked. I puked mostly out of the car, and I think I got a little bit on the door so I wiped it off with my sweater. \*\*This is not the issue, if I got a lot of puke in the car, I totally have no problem paying the fee\*\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I puked, he kept trying to hold my hand. Like consistently. I sat in the front seat because I always feel bad when I sit in the back for some reason. He asked me if he could kiss me. I said no, my boyfriend wouldn't like that, no. He kept asking. He kept trying to hold my hand. I was starting to get creeped out. So I called my SO, who I live with, and asked him to meet me outside of the apartment building. I was really freaked out the rest of the night. It felt like that dude was pushing a lot of boundaries and being inappropriate with someone who was clearly (I mean, I puked) very intoxicated. I was not charged a cleaning fee.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't report it the next day. Honestly, I've had negative experiences before (I've been stalked), so I'm already kind of a paranoid person. I kind of convinced myself that my trip was only 7 dollars, just let it go and try and forget it ever happened. But everyone I have told this story to has told me that I need to report it, and I know that they're right. I don't think he should be a driver. I was going to wait a week to report it so that it wouldn't be so obvious that it was me, since this guy knows where I live. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I was typing this, I got notified that I \*am\* being charged the 150 cleaning fee, so now I am worried if I report it, it's just gonna look like I'm trying to get out of paying that fee.

I have not been able to associate my account with multiple phone numbers. At least not in a way that shares my driving history, rating, and other account information associated with the phone where I first set up Uber.

When I set up Uber on my second phone I used the same user name, email address, and payment methods I'm using for the account I created on my original phone. Uber let me do that, no problem. But the account on my second phone looks like a new user who has never taken a ride.

Is there a way to share my account across both phones?

It took half an hour for someone to show up (the taxi) and I had to cancel my Uber and pay the fee (I totally understand that, wasting my Ubers time).

We then got to the airport to find out we had missed our flight and had to pay $100 for the next flight.

We are now trying to report this original woman, because we would have made the flight if it wasn't for her, but Uber doesn't show her trip as she was the one who cancelled it and I don't want to report the wrong driver.

1531549001,uber,"As an Uber driver, I haven't been spotlighting my awesome Uber experiences as much as the bad ones. Here's balancing it out a little bit, being that I have great experiences more than 98&amp;#37; of the time. Unlike the last time when [my passenger bought me a McDonald's regular iced coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/8satok/my_passenger_bought_me_an_iced_coffee/), this one bought me a full meal this past evening. 

First of all, she requested an UberXL just for herself for safety purposes and for more comfort. It was going to be a twenty-minute trip, so I asked her whether she'd prefer to listen to her music via the car speakers or whether we go all the trip on mute. She laughed and said I should turn on some music and play my own playlist. So I played some regular pop music playlist of songs on Apple Music that I gathered from SiriusXM Venus radio. She sang along very loudly and ended up asking for my number to always call me through the app so as to avoid other drivers-- to which I shrugged off since it doesn't work that way and she seemed to have previously been aware of that because she said she had used Uber almost every week for more than two years now (longer than I've been an Uber driver).

Then towards the end of the trip, she said she was hungry and asked whether I minded going through a drive-thru. In my mind I was like ""come on now, this was almost a five-star ride and you're about to ruin it!"" But then I realized I was hungry and so I said I was starving too, and she asked me what I wanted. I said ""never mind"" since we were at a McDonald's drive-thru while I was really hungry for a Burger King's double whopper sandwich. She said no problem, that a Burger King is nearby and that we should go there and she would buy me the food. I jokingly refused but she insisted, so we went there and she got me a whole meal and soda.  

She being a woman in her mid twenties, gave me her number after I hesitated giving her mine, despite the fact that she mentioned her husband to me numerous times. She then whispered ""Call me if you need anything"" as she handed me a ten-dollar note. It was a priceless experience.

*Processing img z5w6r2wlgu911...*

The same evening, as soon as I returned to my Uber city to resume driving for the rest of the night, I accepted an UberXL request from a 4.4-rated passenger since it was surging three times the regular price, added to my recent excellent experience (I was in a very dreamy, happy mood). So I picked up a group of entitled riders whom I would have never let near my car if I were in my normal mood. Five guys and one girl (no pun intended). One or more of them had a breath that smelled like rotten eggs; whenever one of them spoke I had to open the windows. They immediately asked me for an audio ""aux"" cable so they could play their music on my car speakers, and I gave them the cable. They then started blasting hip hop music very loudly with all windows rolled down in the middle of the night. I'm sure it's important I mention their ethnicity so those with prejudice would be iced down-- this group was white with just one black dude.

My happiness from the previous ride was still holding me strongly. 

They eventually started yelling profanity to pedestrians and any cars they saw passing by. At the end, you guessed it, one of them yelled ""I'll tip you in the app, bro! I'll take care of you. Ten stars bro!"" But as they were leaving, the only girl among them handed me four one-dollar notes and apologized for the ""fools"". I was about to rate the ride requester (a male) five stars for this however I overheard one of the guys shout ""c\*ck sucker!"" while looking towards me after he exited the car. I asked the girl if they were drunk and she said no, they were meeting up to go to a live event in a few days. As they all left, and as I ended the trip, as the rating option screen came up, my finger went over one star, then to five, then back to one. Then I remembered my previous ride again. I decided, I'll just ban this guy from requesting me again, so I just gave him three stars instead of one. My happiness and dreamy mood from the previous trip came back in full.

1531426246,uber,"My girlfriend and I went to see Steely Dan at the BB&amp;T Pavilion last night in Camden, New Jersey. We live just over the Ben Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia, so it is only about a 15 minute ride for us to get there or back. The show ended, and we called an uber to get back home. We got in the car around 11:05 at night, and if you are familiar with the area, getting back on the highway to the Ben Franklin bridge towards Philly is almost a straight shot from the BB&amp;T Pavilion. 

The estimated cost of the ride was about 19 dollars. Almost immediately,  the driver took a wrong turn getting back to the Ben Franklin bridge towards Philly, and so we began to head in the opposite direction. The GPS repeatedly tried to put us back on track, but the driver kept ignoring the instructions. We passed several exits he could have taken to put us on track, but ignored all of them. Eventually, we saw him check off avoid tolls and highways and the GPS, and I knew something was wrong when the GPS said it would take an Hour and 40 minutes to do a trip that shouldn't take more than 20. We pulled over on the highway and struggled to make the driver, who couldn't understand english well enough to get what we were saying, understand that we were going to complete opposite direction. We felt incredibly uneasy, disturbed and very unsafe. Had we not been on a busy highway, we would have gotten out of the car right there. Finally, he handed us his GPS and told us to fix it, and we ended up driving through a small new Jersey town to get back to the highway and eventually the Ben Franklin bridge to get home. We arrived almost a half hour late, and I was charged 38 dollars due to this mistake. 

So I reported the incident as a safety concern to Uber, and detailed my experience. I tried to convey how shocked I was that an uber driver in the Philly area didn't understand how to get back from Camden to Philly, an incredibly basic route. Nor did the driver seemed concerned as the estimated trip length went from about 20 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes, essentially taking us all the way to atlantic city NJ and back. He seemed to have no clue where he was going. Both my girlfriend and I were really sketched out, especially when we pulled off the highway and he told us to figure it out. After messaging Uber back and forth, Uber agreed to refund me for the length of trip that was out of the way, but they would not refund the full cost of the trip, and I still ended up paying the original 19 dollars. 

This is terrible customer service. I have been an Uber user for years and have had nothing but positive experiences. I would have opted for cheaper, faster transportation had I known what my experience would have been like. Not only that, we were really freaked out that this driver had seemingly no clue where he was going, and for that experience alone we should be refunded. I can only image how one would have felt if they were alone.

I am thoroughly surprised and honestly really angry at Uber's refusal to refund the full trip, as far as I am concerned this was a worst case scenario.       ",nightmare uber ride

4. Waiting at my pickup point with 5 grocery bags. Instead of coming near me, he stops a few meters away even though the parking spot right in front of me was empty, making me walk with all those bags. I believe he is the one who rated me less yesterday.

In the past, I've never had an Uber driver tell me to put my things in the backseat, then sit in the front.  On that same note, I've never had an Uber driver tell me to put anything anywhere.  I've actually sat in the front a couple times on short trips when I'm feeling friendly, which is normally the case.  I was exhausted, stressed, and had work to do, but reluctantly obliged the driver who made me miss an important flight.   

There's more, but you get my point. I'm curious how others respond to certain situations where you go with the flow.  My questions relate to the following:  

* How are Uber passengers supposed to respond when their driver should not even be permitted to have a driver's license in the first place?!  
* Are there unspoken rules about where to sit, listening to the driver's music when all you want is peace and quiet, and pointing out poor, unprofessional, potentially dangerous practices to a driver who could probably stop the car and leave you in the middle of nowhere?  
* How do you deal with a failure to receive the services advertised for reasons specifically related to the negligence, disregard, lack of professionalism, and poor service?  NOTE:  The car wasn't what was advertised, it wasn't clean, the driver appeared to have just gotten out of bed, looked at the phone every 10-15 seconds, and, had the speed limit been followed (along with correct, direct directions), I would have received the service as advertised.

1528390255,uber,"I currently work a full time job as does my wife. But we could use more money. Im thinking of signing up for uber on a part time basis.

The only downsides are 1) i haven't driven since 2012 (i use to drive an ambulance occasionally at my last job), 2) i don't own a car, i use public transit. 

I've heard that, although you can make $20+ an hour or whatever theyre advertising now, you have expenses, taxes, etc. Which bring it down to like 10/hr or such. Again, correct me if im wrong.

I know you will probably tell me to just work a 2nd part time regualr job.... Lol its not as easy as it is to just sign up for uber. And im talking about jobs that SHOULD be easy to get... Like stocking/folding clothes at Macy's, Home Depot, etc. You know simple customer service jobs like that, nothing complicated. Well, waiting to hear back from them is like pulling your name out of a hat. Heck, even McDonald's. 

With my experience, I could easily get them.

You could be waiting weeks, months for them to get back, IF they get back to you at all. Maybe this is not the case for those type of jobs wherever you live but thats the case here in NYC unfortunately.

So should i try uber part time or is there some other side-job that i don't know about that is more worthwhile?",Considering Uber for part time income in NYC... Good or bad idea?

I have referred several people and have the promo codes saved to my account. The problem comes however that Uber seems to keep releasing new promotional codes that ultimately defeat mine and will not let me save money by using them. 
The promo they are offering right now is 50% off of 10 rides, up to $10 each time. 

That sounds good right? Except the promotional referral credits give me a free ride up to $10, not just half off. Free ride. Earned it. Can’t use it. 

They will not allow me to use these codes and am forcing me to wait a timer for their promo 50% off to expire. 
Again, the problem is, every time one of these 50% off codes expire, they roll out another one the next morning. I have not been able to use any of my free rides because they constantly keep changing the promotions therefore not allowing me to use my codes. This only happened and started happening once I got my referrals complete. 

What can I do about this? They are seriously driving me nuts. There is no way they can be allowed to do this and their literally forcing me to spend money even though I earned rides to use already. 

They have no way of formally complaining and I’m getting sick and fucking tired of not being able to save money on my short trips.

1525185628,uber,"So I just wanted to share my interaction because it may help other riders that are scammed for cleaning fees (or falsely accused riders).

I woke up the other morning to an email that said my Uber receipt from the previous night had been updated.  I check to see what it was, and I see a $150 charge for a ride that took about 3 miles.  I had no clue what this was about, but noticed a cleaning fee had been added.  

I knew very well that I didn't make a mess in the driver's car, but Uber automatically sides with the driver and immediately charges you for the applied fee.  For me, this was $150. I went to the help section and tried to figure out why I was charged a cleaning fee.

Uber got back to me with pictures.  Apparently somebody threw up over the window in the back left seat (and spilled over the outside of the car door), but that would be pretty damn hard for me to do since I sat in the front passenger seat during my trip.  I asked them to review the time, date, and location stamps from the pictures because that definitely didn't happen on my trip.

And again, Uber's default position is to side with the driver.  I got a response back that basically said ""We understand that these messes are not caused intentionally by the riders. However, that does not remove the responsibility of the cleaning fee from the rider.""  So you are never given the benefit of the doubt that this could possibly be a mistake (or a scam) by the driver.  

My next response was pretty strong, but this was more about principle now instead of money.  Here's my response:

""I will not be held liable for a scam.  I will be reporting you and your driver to the police for fraud.  I will also report you to the Better Business Bureau.  Just because your driver sent in pictures does not mean I created the mess.  I did not make that mess.

I suggest you contact the driver and inform him because I do have his license plate information.

Now you can either work with me to get more information from the driver, or you can face legal action.""

And what do you know...they almost immediately respond with this:

""After further review, we've decided that the correct course of action is to refund the cleaning fee charge.""

Now I'm not certain, but I'm guessing the threat forced further review of the time, date, and location stamps (which should be automatic for customer safety, but it doesn't appear to be).  

So if you're screwed by an Uber driver for a false claim or a scam, they are going to be assholes until you escalate it.

The Monday I got into the office I noticed a $100 charge on my debit card for Uber Credits.  I checked my ride history and the only trip that weekend cost less than the gift card.  So I had the remaining amount of the gift card plus the $100.  I reviewed my email accounts and I never received a receipt or confirmation from Uber regarding the purchase.  I figured the charge was accidental/unauthorized so it would be easy to get a refund.  This is where the my biggest problem with Uber comes in.  They don't have anything in their help section regarding Uber Credits and of course they don't have an email address to contact or a phone number.  I took my fight to twitter to try and get some help from Uber regarding the refund.  Within 15 minutes I had a response from Uber Support saying to check my DMs.  I provide my email and they are quick to send a reach out email.  I explain my situation in the email about the unauthorized charge but they say they noticed a duplicate Uber account.  I don't want to go off on a tangent but I was able to confirm both accounts were mine although one was never used.  I honestly don't see the correlation as the purchase was made on the primary account and the credit is still there in its entirety.  I bring up the duplicate account because that was my last email correspondence with them.  They haven't responded in over 24 hours after their first two messages.  Their twitter support replies quickly through DMs assuring me they are looking into my issue and will respond shortly.  

I guess the purpose of the post is to vent about my frustration with their customer service.  Does anyone have any tips or methods to gouge a response from Uber (or another similar company where their customer service is unreachable)?

For Uber enthusiasts, does anyone see actual value of Uber credits within the app for yourself?  I understand buying gift cards for friends/fams but they promote it in the app as preparing yourself for the next ride. You would essentially be buying yourself a gift card with your own money.

The guy who requested the trip was very nice and friendly, his passenger sitting directly behind me was not. 

The start. I confirmed with the riders that we are going to the best western in &lt;insert city 20 miles away&gt; and the booking rider confirms. He is quite intoxicated but was coherent enough to answer and carry on a conversation. 

As we are leaving the town the lady sitting directly behind me said ""I don't remember it being this far"". 
I asked her what she meant and she said ""the freeway on ramp"" which we were driving up.
Normal conversations continue from then and about 5 minutes later driving 65mph down a freeway she asks ""I don't think this is right"". 
At this point I say ""we are going to the best western in &lt;city&gt;, right?"" Again
She says ""no it's the one in town where I picked them up"". 

At this point the booking rider says ""I am sorry I guess I put in the wrong location"". Not any problem for me.  I continue driving them back when she chimes in ""don't you ask if the location is correct if the rider is complaining the whole time about it being too far""

I responded with ""I am sorry. I only go where the gps tells me, and when I confirmed best western in &lt;city&gt; the rider confirmed"". I can tell she is thinking about how she can dispute the ride, get their money back for it being a $20 ride instead of a $7 ride.  Whatever. 

Dropped them off and went on to the next ride. This time it was a group of drunk women. Heading back to their rented house. While talking with them the topic comes up of ""bad riders"". I tell them the story about the previous riders and in particular ""her"". As they are hopping out of the car I check the backseat and notify them that someone lost their debit card. They all look at the card a little bewildered, ""that's not ours, oh that's hers!""  

They suggested that I cut up the card and don't do anything about it because of how she was acting. I did what I should. I notified uber that I found a debit card. Took a photo of it with the number covered so it showed just the name. Waited for a response. 2 hours later I get a notice that uber closed the case because it contained personal sensitive information. Oh well. I did my job trying to return it. I could have gone to the hotel(I dropped off 3 more rides there that night)

1522206442,uber,"Not sure where to post this since it's not specific to Uber, but r/ridesharing looks pretty dead so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.

I live in NYC and take a lot of cabs using Uber, Lyft, and Juno. As of the new year the odds of being scammed and majorly inconvenienced as a result have increased from 1 in maybe 50 ride requests to 1 in 2. It's to the point where I'm not at all surprised when it happens and even kind of expect it. Instead of doing their job, these drivers would rather inconvenience people all over the city, $5 at a time.

I understand the fact that these companies have changed their policies a lot since the beginning, and those changes have made it harder for drivers to earn a living. We're all out here trying to make ends meet and I realize how difficult that can be, especially here where the income disparity is what it is.

What I don't understand is how driving around scamming potential passengers all day is a more viable way to make money through these services than just doing the job. Do the companies not realize what's happening? Why is there **no** way to hold these drivers responsible? How do that many cancellations and refund requests not add up in a meaningful way on their accounts?  Where did so many people get the idea to do this?

I guess I should also mention that I always make sure the pickup pin is in the right spot, I close the app and reopen it when it seems like it's not working, and when I contact the driver I do it politely and with the assumption that whatever went wrong is not their fault. And each time I'm yelled at over the phone to cancel, or the driver never picks up, or they drive almost all the way to me and then cancel within a block. I've also never cancelled on someone first because I assume that gets them paid somehow. 

I hope this doesn't come off as disrespectful or accusatory, that isn't my intention; I'm honestly blown away by the fact that I've requested 4 rides so far this week and 2 of them were delayed more than 20 minutes because I had to deal with a scammer.

Thanks to people who clarified.

Does this happen to anyone else? I live in Melbourne CBD and whilst the trip is technically ""nearby"", traffic means it'll take the driver ages to reach me.

Right now I've been waiting 20 minutes for my guy to crawl his way up Collins street. It doesn't look like he'll be here for another 10. Meanwhile, 3-4 uber drivers have picked up others who haven't been waiting long at all.

I use uber for how quick it used to get me into a car. I may as well take a cab at this point. Is this intended?

Quite frankly it's unacceptable to wait that long when all estimates on the app point towards ""5 nearby drivers within 4 minutes"". Well, I've been waiting 6x that estimate now

EDIT: just got into the uber, a nice 30 mins after I ordered one

EDIT2: I understand completely that this was in no way shape or form the fault of the driver. Thanks to everyone who explained that to me. I was ignorant to that fact.

The issue is with the system for not communicating things like this to the passengers. Also in highly congested areas, whilst distance wise the trip was nearby, we all know that in cities traffic plays a much larger part than distance. Nearby in cities should take traffic into account, and for a multi million dollar company, it amazes me that it doesn't.

The driver was visibly frustrated when he picked me up. He knew he shouldn't have been given that fare, but he had no idea. He was apologetic even though as I've learnt it's not his fault. 

Thanks to everyone who gave me some insight into how the system works for drivers. It's very, very flawed it seems.","""completing nearby trip"""

We recieved a Ford Explorer that had its extra seats folded down and covered, and our driver told us to just squeeze in the back (so we were short 1 seat and seatbelt). I wish we had just turned around and called a different Uber but it was late and cold and we wanted to get home. 
The next morning I submitted a complaint that we did not receive the UberXL I ordered but I was still charged for one. They immediately refunded me $18.
THEN I recieved a charge of $21. I contacted them through their ridiculous app help feature that is basically just texting with a different person responding each time. They said they had confirmed that we did receive an UberXL. I fought this and explained the situation again. They proceeded to adjust the price again and gave me a refund of $21. 
The next day I recieved an email stating that my driver had reported me for drinking alcohol in the Uber. This is completely untrue. None of us had any drinks of any kind. But the email was just a “warning” and I planned to delete my account as soon as the refunds went through anyway so I didn’t respond. 
Then tonight I recieved ANOTHER charge of $40. Apparently the driver then accused me of making a mess in the car (just shy of 48 hours later) and the $40 was a cleaning fee. We didn’t make any mess!!!
I went back to their dumb app “help” chat and fought this claim. Finally someone replied with the photos the driver had submitted. It shows a can of hard cider on its side on what looks like pavement, not even in a car. And the entire photo is blurry.
I’m still fighting it for I refuse to pay money to clean a mess we didn’t make and I requested to see timestamps of the photos.

Under the ride sharing account, they replaced the 123@gmail.com with 456@gmail.com. Here's where they screwed up. They put the delivery partner account on hold so I can't even log into it.

So, now, I log into the Uber Driver app with 456@gmail.com and the password associated with the 123@gmail.com account and I'm logged on for ride sharing (which I never participated in).

I contact support and they argue with me for about 30 minutes until a supervisor comes on the line to try and sort things out. He gives me this BS about having to do another background check to take the account off of hold. It's not until I tell him that I'm able to log into the Uber Driver app for ride sharing that he realizes, oh crap, they put the wrong account on hold.

Now, I have to wait for them to correct their error ... which is essentially costing me money.

As far as my customer accounts and promo codes are concerned, I could care less about them now. Hopefully they fix this error and get my delivery partner account reactivated without me having to wait 7 to 10 days to do a delivery.

SMH!!! SMH!!! SMH!!!

Update: Now, both the ride sharing and delivery partner accounts are disabled. WTF?!?!",Gotta love Uber support. SMH!!!

1519406851,uber,"I’ll start it off. 

I’m in Los Angeles and have requested two Uber Express Pool rides in the last 24 hours. I say requested because I only made it onto one ride, and as for the other, almost got run down trying to locate my driver and get to a safer pick up spot. 

First ride: Pick up was a block and a bit from my home, which is great, minimal walking. I’m thinking to myself great! It’s just like NYC, walk to a convenient cross street and business as usual. 

Drop off was a different story. Drop off was on a dark street blocks away from my final destination and super abrupt as well as my driver had trouble figuring out where to drop me. Tbh I had no idea he was going to drop me off there either. I get out of the Uber and sprint to my destination. 

Second ride: This is where it gets fun. This morning I requested a ride from Mid city and surprise surprise the pick up point is some place diagonally across the street. Looking at the map I see it’s on the corner of a a triangular grass patch banded by three busy streets, two turn offs and god knows how many turning lanes. To add to this there was another residential cut through street immediately before the grass patch that fed cars continuously into the mix. 

You’d think, grass patch with tiny walking path, all curbs painted red, probably not a great pick up spot, am I right? I’m standing there in the wind, trying to figure out which direction my driver is coming from, finally deciding to try and get to a safer street and call him when I almost get side swiped by a car; I was that close to morning traffic. 

Suffice to say, my driver actually turned off on the wrong street because who in their right mind would pull to a stop in the middle of moving traffic? I didn’t wind up catching an Uber and am now at the nearest Starbucks draining what’s left of my battery waiting for regular Uber rates to resume.

My company just started offering commuter benefits this year (you spend money pretax instead of post-tax, so you can basically save the percentage of whatever your marginal tax rate is times the amount you spend commuting/parking, up to $260 a month total in 2018 ). One of the options is uberPOOL (it's wonky though, only uberPOOLs that seat 6+ qualify, Uber has coded this on the backend so wait times and costs can increase apparently).

Anyways while glancing at this I found a single passing reference in this businessInsider article
&gt;*It's perfectly legal to use UberPool pretax coming home drunk from a bar on the weekend, just as it is with an unlimited subway pass. All Uber has to do is make sure the car it sends has at least six seats.*

http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-found-a-tax-loophole-that-lets-people-ride-for-cheaper-2016-10

Also here's the relevant 2017 IRS Employers guide to fringe tax benefits, which seems to place the burden of commutership on the vehicle owner (if deeming it a commuter vehicle, though the relevant section for what uber has negotiated with the government seems to be the one below that marked ""Transit Pass"")
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15b.pdf#page=18

Anyone have any thoughts on this? Definitely seems to go against the spirit of the law, but if it is legal then its not fraud or anything sketchy right? Bonus question, would you consider it immoral to use the law of the land to save yourself a bit of drunken weekend uber ride costs? Thank you!","Is it true that one can use commuting benefits for uberPOOL even if it has nothing to do with work (EG weekend, neither destination is your house or office)?"

As a matter of policy, I'm rating you lower for saying this, and I encourage other drivers to do the same. Riders have made it a point to say this now to ensure a 5-star rating so they feel good about themselves, but drivers aren't stupid; we can tell the sociopaths from the genuinely grateful passengers. 

This isn't an exaggeration, I always check that ride's details the next day when you say this, and nearly 100% of the time, no tip ever appears. Magically, however, people who express gratitude in other ways (""thank you"" or ""I really appreciate the ride, man!"") often leave actual tips in the app. 

Funny how that works. 

(For the record, I don't rate lower just if I think someone isn't going to tip, I rate someone lower if they treat me lower. There is a difference.

1516302179,uber,"For the last two years, I've had a problem with Uber where it thinks that my house is adjacent to a different street, but one cannot drive or walk between the two due to a large wall that walls off a townhouse community.

This has been a constant problem for myself and drivers because they'll go to where they're told they can pick me up, only to find that they can't get here from there.  That ends up with cancelled trips or 5 extra minutes of driving (due to then needing to make U-turns and so on). To Uber's credit, I haven't had a problem with requesting refunds for the cancelled trips.

I submitted a clear routing problem to Google about a year back, and see that Google maps (and also Waze) now routes it correctly.  I thought that this would resolve the issue with Uber (since I believe they use Google maps), but it has not.

Uber drivers are still being sent to the wrong place.  Additionally, with Uber Pool, I'm being asked to walk to the other side of the wall, and not given enough time to walk around ""the long way"".  It would be about 1 minute to walk if I could go over the wall, but 14 minutes due to the wall.

Questions are: why did it take thirty minutes? Why did it default to a three star in the meantime?
